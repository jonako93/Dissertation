Unfortunately my doctors are standing firm on the no MS thing and haven’t been able to convince them to give me a LP.\\nThere is no single test, by it's self, that can give a diagnosis of MS. For this reason MS can be difficult to diagnose. A LP is usually one of the last tests to be given as it is quite invasive and a negative LP does not rule MS out.\\nAs I said in an earlier post the diagnostic criteria relies heavily on MRI evidence and since you don't have lesions the medical thought is you don't have MS, so why do an invasive? (right or wrong). Lesions are a hallmark of this disease, however not all lesions are MS type lesions. Other conditions can cause lesions.\\nHere is a link to some of those other conditions that mimic MS:\\nhttps://www.nationalmssociety.org/Sy...ns-to-Rule-Out\\nIf you did not have a spine MRI done then I would suggest asking the Neurologist about doing one. MS is a disease of the Central Nervous System(CNS), which includes the brain, optic nerves, and spinal cord. Lesions can and do show up anywhere within the CNS.

It started 30 years ago. I did have an episode of vertigo, which seemed to affect my cognitive focus 3 years after the tingling started. Then nothing for another 13 years. I was finally diagnosed 16 years after the tingling started. I had brain lesions and numerous lesions C2-C6.\\nI have no leg symptoms. I had some numbness during a relapse, but it resolved. My hand tingling has progressed to full right arm numbness, which sometimes feels like I have a fully inflated blood pressure cuff on. My other symptoms I struggled with were cognitive and fatigue. But anyone who doesn't know me, would never guess, other than think I am clumsy, as I drop things constantly with the right hand. I have been trying to learn to do more left handed.\\nI did struggle some with balance a few years back, but worked with PT. They said legs were fine, just needed to work on combination of vestibular therapy tied to physical movement. It resolved.\\nEveryone's path with MS is different. I wish I had been diagnosed earlier, wonder if I had started on a DMT earlier, would I have progressed? I will never know. I stabilized once I started on Tysabri.\\nStay active, eat healthy. Have you tried any PT for your hand? I do some exercises to try and maintain the dexterity I still have. Is it possible to play tennis, just at a less competitive level than you are used to?

So I played in a fun league for years.\\nI am curious, did your neuro say MS treatment medications are too aggressive or is that your personal thought?

My doc said it was unrelated. He has not made a distinction between PPMS and SPMS. Keep in mind that I have not lost the use of my hands. I only have the numbness/tingling and burning while maintaining full functionality. I could play tennis, but as you say, not at the competitive level I like to.

Thanks for the reintroduction. It looks like you've been a member here for awhile, but just started posting again the last couple of months. I appreciate knowing your history.\\n((Sigh)). Yeah, disability. Tough subject. Ya know, most of us who go on disability don't want to take that step. Sometimes the stereotype that the public might hold about us is that we're just a bunch of slackers who don't want to work. But, in my experience, that's seldom the case. You said that your wife and your parents want you to go on disability. What are their reasons for those feelings? Do they see some challenges for you that indicate maybe it's time?\\nHere's my story.\\nI'm 58 now. My MS started in 2002, with a bang. After multiple ER visits and hospitalizations following a stroke-like incident which was actually my first MS flare, I had to take 8 months off (two more flares, with very different symptoms, during those months). I lost my job.\\nLike you, I wanted to get back to work. I opened a licensed day care home which I did for about a year and a half. Another major flare, another job loss, another 8 months off of work.\\nHubby wanted me, both times, to get on disability. But, after I recovered, I got another job, this time as a para in a school district. I worked there for 4 years. I struggled, too, with staying awake on the job, but it was in the afternoons during down time when I was working alone and others likely didn't notice the catnups I took because they weren't around to view it. And, every year, I had one or two flares and multiple times off of work and had to use FMLA leave 3 years in a row. When, the fourth year, I applied for FMLA again, I lost this job.\\nIt was at this point (in 2008), that I realized that, maybe, I wasn't very employable anymore. I applied for SSDI disability.. I worked hard at my application, adding all the details that I believed would help my case. Three doctors (PCP, psychologist, neurologist) recommended that I needed to go on disability. I was approved quickly, due probably to my 3 job losses which indicated my desire to stay working, my doctors' recommendations, and many many medical records. After my approval, I was also still eligible to apply for LTD (long term disability) from my job which I also received. Soon, it will convert to a retirement benefit for me.\\nI grieved giving up my career. But, I truly believe that it was time. Falling asleep at work makes it sound like it might be time for you.\\nA disability income allows you the freedom to choose what you want to do with your time. You could even work part time, if you take care to keep your income below the required level. For, many years, I did a significant amount of volunteering in the community (5-15 hours a week). I was able to start exercising and getting enough rest and taking care of myself better.\\nIt might be time for you to move on. If not, I wish you the best in keeping your job. But I encourage you to consider your options, talk to your family and weigh the pros and cons.\\nWishing you the best.\", 'Hello lukeduke\\nThank you for sharing your experience with us.\\nGood luck with SSDI, or with finding a job that is doable, and that you enjoy.\\nTake Care', \"Originally posted by Carlyle View Post\\nHi I’ve had a stroke and was wondering if anyone had a stroke and how are doing?did you recover?I would like to hear comments\\nHi Carlyle\\nAre you referring to the stroke you had last year, or have you had a second one (hopefully not a second one)?\\nI recall that you were having PT at home, if I'm not mistaken.

Glad you found us.\\nIt takes a little while to get used to a diagnosis and can sometimes be an emotional roller coaster ride. At least it was for me.\\nI am not familiar with Canadian employment laws. In the US, we have protection laws, but even then, sometimes discrimination may occur. So here, they recommend not disclosing unless you need to ask for an accomodation to do your job. Even then, you don't need to disclose, just have a doctor's note stating you have a medical condition, and need a specific accomodation(s) to do your job.\\nI did disclose when having trouble completing my work and had multiple short term disability leaves. I had asked for an accomodation, providing a flexible work schedule from home, with longer mid day breaks,when needed. The doctors request did not say MS, but I verbally told my boss, his boss, and my teammates about my diagnosis. I had impacted some key project dates that they were all taking heat on, so I felt I owed them the truth. This occurred 8 years after diagnosis and 21 years after first relapse.\\nIf you are not sure, check into Canadian protection laws. If you are showing symptoms, but aren't sure about disclosing and people ask, you can always say you are under a doctor's care and testing, just not letting on you have an answer.\\nGood luck with Tecfidera and welcome again!\", 'My symptoms are not visible....

Eye floaters are not caused by Multiple Sclerosis.\\nAGAIN, I am aware of this. But again you assume to know my situation and make comments arguing my statements. My floaters were very large and causing major issues. The doctor who removed them did so for that reason and the result of having them removed was amazing.

Honestly, the first thought that came to my mind was \"Well, DUH!\" Hind sight is 20/20 (even though my vision is not). I trusted a doctor I should not have trusted but I will restate this again: the vision problems that *MIGHT* be MS related were there before the surgery and remain after the surgery. Yes, they might not have anything to do with MS at all, but they are a possible symptom and three doctors have all advised me that in the grand scheme of things....they matter.\\nHave you been to the Dr. to see about having your anxiety/panic attacks treated? If not I would suggest doing so. Anxiety/panic attacks can cause body wide physical symptoms. If treated you might find an improvement with symptoms.\\nIf I can repeat myself...again, I know this. I had two panic attacks over the course of a summer that included four separate eye surgeries. I am not overly prone to panic or anxiety.\\nYou know, the way I look at it is like this. I DON\\'T WANT to have MS. No one does. But I also don\\'t WANT to keep having undiagnosed symptoms that are making my life quite miserable. I WANT answers. I DON\\'T WANT to have to over explain things to people. I WANTED to be a part of a community that uplifts and encouraged and shares. Darn it, maybe I even WANTED to hear, \"Yeah, I had all that too and it ended up not being MS but something much easier to deal with.\"\\nI didn\\'t want to feel foolish or like I am forced to defend every statement I make just because someone believes that they know me or the things I am going through. I\\'ve spent years doing that already with Fibro and the thought scares me out of my mind that people might look at me the same way now when I KNOW that something is not right.\\nLook, I\\'m sorry if I have you pegged wrong, but maybe you might stop and think about the way you respond to others.

Causes of constipation include:\\n-Insufficient fluid intake\\n-Reduced physical activity and mobility\\n-Decreased or slowed “motility” (movement of food through the intestinal tract)\\n-Side effects of certain medications\\nLoss of bowel control in MS could be neurologic in origin (or related to constipation) and should be evaluated by your MS provider.\\nBowel regularity\\nA healthcare provider can help establish an effective bowel management program. Occasionally, it might be necessary to consult a gastroenterologist, a physician specializing in the stomach and bowel.\\nBowel regularity generally can be maintained by following a few simple suggestions:\\n-Drink adequate amounts of fluids — at least 48 ounces (6 to 8 glasses) of fluids daily.\\n-Include plenty of fiber in your diet. Fiber can be obtained from fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grain breads and cereals, and dietary additives such as powdered psyllium preparations.\\n-Get some physical activity. It helps keep things moving.\\n-Establish a regular time and schedule for emptying the bowels (bowel training/retraining).\\nDiscuss remedies such as stool softeners, bulk forming supplements, enemas, suppositories or manual stimulation with your healthcare provider.

Not having answers is frustrating. Hope you get some soon. Lots of luck.', 'I know you all arent medical professionals, and I have had, and continue to have, plenty of appointments. But Ive also found a lot of information and perspectives here that doctors haven’t shared, and I am really taking my self advocacy very seriously. To that end, I have questions for your feedback.\\nIm at a place where I think, as many people here do, that I may have been having symptoms going back over 18 years or so. Mostly bladder urgency, and then facial numbness a few years ago. Problems always resolved themselves within weeks, so I thought nothing of it.\\nBut my current situation has been going on for almost 7 months now. Tremor in hands, numbness in hands and feet, memory issues, bladder urgency, tightness in my calves, twitching all over, ringing and popping in my ears, now I am having crazy night sweats and trouble sleeping, etc. Everything comes and goes, like the bladder only lasted a few weeks, but the whole suite of symptoms is sticking around and rotating throughout my body. Memory issues everyday.\\nI guess my question is: are the doctors looking for a flare? I see so much written about people going totally and temporarily numb or blind and it goes away. Something big and obvious. And it seems like the doctors are looking at me and not seeing a “flare” like that and being dismissive.\\nIve had a lot of tests since May. First MRI came back with “a few tiny foci” but nueros said not of a size, shape or location to cause concern. Spine MRI clear. Contrast MRI came back as “normal MRI of the Brain”, and Lumbar Puncture showed no obands in relation to my serum. These were all done at highly ranked Academic Med centers in NYC.\\nAny thoughts on how to continue advocating for myself beside third and fourth opinions? Is it “just keep going”, have patience and wait? If, indeed, this has been going on for 18 years, there would be something distinct and irrefutable on my MRI, no?\\nAny advice welcome.', \"Originally posted by Xyz789 View Post\\nI guess my question is: are the doctors looking for a flare?

Are doctors looking for a flare -- good question. It's, actually, a question I wouldn't have thought to ask. At this point, I suspect, they are looking for a diagnosis. Regardless of what the diagnosis turns out to be, multiple illnesses could have flares.\\nIf docs are looking for a dx, then, when they make a diagnosis, they can begin to look at strategies to treat the illness (DMD -- disease-modifying meds). But, if they're just looking for a dx and not a flare, then they may not be considering how to treat your symptoms.\\nHowever, if they identify what you have as a likely flare, in whatever illness it may be, they could treat the symptoms of the flare. Even before they have diagnosed an illness. is that why you're asking? If it's a flare, it could be treated with steroids. Even if it's not a flare, the symptoms might benefit from treatment with other meds.\\nThe thoughts that your questions triggered in me take me back to my pre-diagnosis stage. My neuro was looking for a dx, and while considering MS as a possibility, was ruling out all kinds of other illnesses. But, he was focusing on finding a dx. And, my symptoms continued to become worse and worse. It was actually my husband's personal care physician, who was also a personal friend of the family, that prescribed steroids to help to manage the symptoms, because I was so very ill and still in limbo. He seemed to be quicker to realize that my symptoms needed to be acknowledged and managed, even while the process of being diagnosed was still underway.\\nIs that the direction you're going with your question? That, if you are in a flare, regardless of the dx, the flare needs to be acknowledged and treated? Or, even if your symptoms aren't triggered by a flare, they still could benefit from treatment?\\nOr, am I reading things in between the lines that aren't there? Are you asking for different reasons?\", 'Its not necessarily what I was getting at, but its very helpful advice, regardless. Thank you very much.\\nI am just wondering if I could possibly be in a flare for...what is going on almost 7 months now. With little to no evidence on any MRI or LP?

And the new night sweats just seem like a kick in the pants to anything getting better/remitting anytime soon.', 'Most flares don\\'t last that long, even without steroids. I seem to be an exception to that.\\nPrior to diagnosis, my second flare went on and on and got worse untily husband\\'s PCP rx\\'d steroids. After that, I always had steroids until two other times. I won\\'t go into detail, but they were also not resolved, and got worse, until steroids were started. Maybe not seven months, but sometimes 3-5 months.\\nSo, yeah. In your situation, I don\\'t know if it\\'s still a flare that would benefit from steroids.\\nBut that\\'s a question you could ask. You could also ask about meds for symptom management.\\nIn the meantime, take care of yourself.\\n- Get enough sleep.\\n- Prevent stress when possible. Learn how to manage it when it\\'s not preventable.\\n- Consider yoga, mindfulness, meditation, a cup of tea, a soothing bath, listening to relaxing music, deep breathing, identifying your \"happy place\" and going there in your mind, etc.\\n- Eat a healthy diet. Lots of greens and other fruits and vegetables (consider 9 total per day), grass fed meats / free range poultry (sparingly), as much wild- caught fish as you want,. Consider wheat free, dairy free, no can sugar or artificial sweeteners (honey and 100% maple syrup ok; stevia ok).\\n- Exercise moderately.\\n- Get rid of toxins in your environment.', 'Since I had a negative LP, I am finding it hard to believe with my symptoms.

I'm glad that the brain MRI showed as normal, with no signs of optic neuritis, but I've heard that in the early stages of MS that lesion activity may not show up on an MRI, but I don't know how accurate this is. I think I am going to try to make an appointment with the Neuro-Muscular specialist at this point and see what he/she's reccomendation is. I also am still considering seeing the Lyme specialist who uses a private lab in CA (Igenix) that supposedly has more accurate testing protocols than the CDC methods.\", \"Something else that I wanted to share that seems to be occuring more frequently now.

I had an appointment yesterday with a Neuromuscular specialist. He did an extensive physical examination and then performed both an EMG and Nerve Conduction study. At the end he concluded that he strongly believes I do not have a neuromuscular disorder, or show any signs of muscle atrophy.\\nWhile this is good news in the sense that is likely not a muscle degenerative disorder, it brings me back to square one. I asked about the likelihood of this being MS and he felt it was not based on the clear brain MRI but said I could see a MS specialist if I wanted to. He seemed to suggest that my symptoms are more psychological and that I should take a break from seeing specialists for a couple months.\\nI have an appointment tomorrow with my Primary Care Provider to re-group and go over what I have had done, as I have not had an appointment with him in a couple of months. I am considering asking him about both having an MRI of the spinal cord, as well as a referral to a MS specialist.\\nI'm looking for feedback as to whether it would make sense to request a spinal cord MRI first and then depending on the results, then have a referral to a MS specialist if something suspicious was seen. The other option is to hold off on the spinal MRI and just be referred to the MS specialist to see what their recommendations are. Of course I would need to get my PCP to agree to one of these options.\\nI continue to have the same symptoms. I have the intermittent left shoulder pain, along with the muscle spasms/twitching in the calves (legs), upper arms, and left eye-brow area. I also have what feels like tears behind the outside corner of my eyes (only 1 eye at a time does it occur though).\\nAnyways, what are your thoughts? Perhaps I should be looking at seeing a Rheumotologist or Immunologist? Thanks in advance.\", \"Kevin,\\nIf you see an MS specialist, they will look at all the tests done to date. They may only order a spinal MRI if you show clinical abnormalities. It is possible they would order even with normal exam, but be prepared they may not. If you do get a spinal MRI from your PCP and it is clear, it may be difficult to get an appointment with an MS specialist. They often ask who is referring you, what tests you have and results - at least that was my experience.\\nAre you dismissing that the variety of symptoms may have a psychological and or anxiety component to them? Personally, if I was told that I didn't have MS and my symptoms were psychological, as frustrating as it is, I would be celebrating. Yes, there are stories of people having been told that, only to find out years later it is MS. But I think this is getting rarer as MRI technology gets better and MS knowledge has improved. While not every lesion will show on an MRI, and some may even disappear, there is usually a clinical abnormality. Some docs may do a spinal tap in that scenario.\", \"Hi kdrymer.\\nHe seemed to suggest that my symptoms are more psychological and that I should take a break from seeing specialists for a couple months.\\nI am curious why you would discount the possibility that has been suggested to you by a Physician. At this point there have been no physical findings or testing by a Neurologist or Neuro-Muscular Dr. that your symptoms are in within their specialty.\\nIt is very possible for stress and anxiety to cause physical symptoms which can be similar to MS and other conditions.

I am a physical therapist and I used to work on an MS unit at a rehab hospital for a number of years and then in their homes.

I developed a game with my neurologist to see if I could guess which part of the brain had the lesion before we looked at the MRI.\\nRecently my job came to an end. I decided to just tell everyone.

You are 29 and knowledge is rapidly expanding so it is likely that tremendous strides will be taken in the treatment of MS and MS symptoms during your lifetime which will benefit you greatly.\\nFor now, please don't do anything which might disqualify you for an approved DMT should you change your mind and desire to try one. Some insurance companies will not pay for some very expensive DMTs if your diagnosis is PPMS rather than RRMS.\\nRight now, Ocrevus is the only DMT approved for PPMS. Any insurance company paying $76,000 a year (last year's average cost of an MS DMT) for something not even approved for the condition or disease could legally stop at any time.\\nOf course, they would have to pay for symptom management, however, not for a DMT unless it was Ocrevus, the only approved DMT for PPMS.\\nAll I am saying is don't let your neuro make a decision which can limit your options.

I woke up having actually tried to do this in my sleep, and had succeeded in throwing myself out of bed doing a 360 and and landing a metre from my bed and up against the wall in the middle of the night! I\\'m not sure whether to be proud of myself and proclaim my acrobatic accomplishments to the world and bare the bruises like battle scars or be embarrassed?\\nI do know one thing though - I ain\\'t missin takin any of dem dare pills agin!!!\\nAny hoooo i hope my little nocturnal adventure gives you guys a giggle.\\nCaroline.', 'Caroline,\\nNever a dull moment around there!

Though i have not been as diligent about it lately.\\nI will check out the ssdi info later- should be interesting- we are headed to our farm for the weekend- and will get back to you.\\nThanks.\", \"Hi,\\nHad a nice weekend away.\\nTy infusion then farm.\\nDidn't do much because my rump is black and purple from hitting the wall and of course rather sore.\\nRead a couple studies already completed regarding ssdi's (mostly fluoxetine) and their effect in spms progression. Interesting but inconclusive so far. need more participants to complete and needs to be stretched over a longer time. maybe the new study you found Myoak may address these issues.\\nMajority of participants taking fluoxetine reported increased fatigue (especially at outset) The mind boggles when we consider that this is the symptom that this med is usually prescribed for.\\nWould love to discover a magic remedy for fatigue- slept 15 hrs yesterday and still could doze off.\\nHas anyone else ever done weird things while on or quitting these meds or is it just me?\\nCaroline.\", \"Hello Carol,\\nThere seem to be many MSers taking B12 for fatigue and I believe it helps. It isn't a complete answer but if we can do a lot of small things which are beneficial then maybe we can achieve something significant in fighting fatigue. As you said, Vitamin D is awfully important, too. I can't imagine anyone with MS not knowing what their Vit D level is. I see you are on Tysabri. How is that going? May I ask how often you get infusions? Are you JCV+?\\nBest!\\nHi Caroline,\\nYep, pretty odd that a med to help with fatigue often makes you more fatigued when starting. Welcome to the world of MS meds! We all hope better things come along soon and of course, there are numerous studies always taking place so we do expect better treatments for fatigue to become available.\\nI wanted to ask the same question of you, Caroline... how often do you get infusions of Tysabri? I'm a little embarrassed to ask the next question because I should have remembered but I'm too lazy to go back and look through your posts... are you JCV+?\\nAs you know, I am really beginning to question the wisdom of my spouse switching from Tysabri to Ocrevus as expressed in other threads.\\nBe well!

There have been many up and downs, but this last bad relapse has overwhelmed me. A month ago my husband had a second heart attack. We live in northern British Columbia and he was sent by air ambulance to a bigger center. He had 5 stents put in and was sent home. He absolutely refused to have me come with him, and our daughter was with him. The stress of sitting by the phone waiting for a call was so difficult. I thought I was going to lose him. Then two days after Ken came home, our beloved little dog had multiple seizures and died in my arms. (There is no vet available here on weekends.) Then there were some extended family stresses I could do nothing about. No surprise - a week ago I had a big relapse that hit my legs and vision.\\nI had 3 days of IV Solumedrol that were difficult (anxiety and panic attacks). Now I'm left with painful muscle spasms in my legs and I feel overwhelmed and hopeless. I tried to talk to my family doctor and was given a prescription for antidepressants. She has never been very supportive and appointments are always rushed. I'm trying to be strong for my husband, but am not sleeping and my legs are hurting. This is so difficult and I don't have anyone to talk to.\\nThank you for listening. Someone please tell me that things will get better.\\nLisa\\nHi Lisa\\nI can't even imagine going through the heartaches and stresses that you have endured during the past month. I feel for you, and am sending healing thoughts your way.\\nIt seems that for now, you need to take care of yourself, especially getting good sleep. Lack of sleep for those of us with MS can wreak havoc with our physical, mental, and emotional well being.\\nLife is a little more tolerable, and doesn't look quite as bad, when we are well rested.\\nDid your doctor prescribe anything for your painful leg spasms? I wonder if treating your spasms would then help you to sleep better?\\nI do think that things will get better for you. Try to make it a priority to take good care of yourself, ok? Don't be afraid to call your doctor if you need something for the painful spasms.\\nAlso, feel free to vent as much as you need to! We'll be here to listen.\\nWishing both you and your husband quick recoveries, and hope you feel better each day.\\nTake Care\", \"I'm so sorry Lisa. We are here for you anytime you need to vent. Maybe seeing a pt? My pt is the one who helps me a lot with the spasticity and spasms. He also gave me the exercises(stretches) to do at home. Anyone dealing with what you are would be anxious and stressed. It makes the spasms worse. I do know that the stretches get the blood flowing and even doing that can help along with breathing. also try to get some sleep as was previously mentioned.\\nCan you maybe switch to a different reg doc?

Your many situations, experiences and losses, coupled with living in a somewhat isolated location, in terms of medical services, provides you with many challenges.\\nI don\\'t really have any additional advice, other than trying to take care of yourself while you recover from your flare, and trying to reduce stress.\\nFor me, I have personally found that managing stress, after it occurs, is difficult. Instead, I have tried, as much as possible (and it isn\\'t always possible), to prevent stress. I use techniques such as saying \"no\" to others when I need to, advocating for my own needs, getting plenty of rest, adding in some pamper-time (whatever restores your spirit -- it\\'s different for us all), finding one or more supportive friends or family members, asking for help when I need it, etc.\\nIf your husband also needs care, at this point, it sounds like you are unable to provide it.

Going forward, Progressive MS is going to get far more attention than previously and its about time, too!\\nJust to follow up on the food and diet posts above I will post part of an abstract to be presented at ECTRIMS on Oct. 10...', \"Diet quality is associated with mobility and cognitive function in people with multiple sclerosis\\nBackground: People with multiple sclerosis (MS) are at increased risk of metabolic disorders like diabetes and hyperlipidemia. Aspects of diet are important determinants of metabolic comorbidities in the general population and influence mechanisms relevant to MS (immune/mitochondrial function, oxidative stress and action of gut microbiota). However, evidence linking diet with objective MS outcomes is sparse.\\nObjective: To assess the association between diet quality and disability and neurological function in people with MS.\\nMethods: We conducted an observational study of people with MS who completed MS Performance Test-based (MSPT) assessment of neurologic function and a 153-item food frequency questionnaire. For each individual, we calculated the Healthy Eating Index-2010, which is a composite measure of dietary quality favorably weighting an individual's intake of fruits, vegetables, legumes, seafood/plant proteins, whole grains, mono/polyunsaturated fat, other proteins and unfavorably weighting intakes of sodium, added-sugars and refined grains. Scores ranged from 0 (poorest quality) to 100 (optimal quality). We evaluated the association between diet scores and MS outcomes including disability (Patient Determined Disease Steps [PDDS]) and objective neurological outcomes (walking speed, manual dexterity and processing speed) using generalized linear models, as appropriate and adjusting for age, sex, disease subtype and duration, years of education and body mass index (BMI).\\nResults: We analyzed data from 277 participants (78% female, mean age: 48.2y [standard deviation; SD: 12.7y], mean BMI: 28.2 [SD: 7.5]) who completed MSPT and diet assessments. Participants in the highest quartile of dietary quality had significantly higher processing speeds, faster 25-foot walking speeds and marginally faster manual dexterity speeds relative to individuals in the lowest quartile... Individuals in the highest quartile were also at a significantly lower risk of moderate vs. mild disability.\\nConclusions: High dietary quality was associated with lesser disease severity using measures of disability, mobility and cognitive function. Longitudinal studies should evaluate if high quality diets predict slower rates of disability accrual.\", 'Welcome!victordan,as you know there is a vast of information on this site.we look forward to hearing from you!

I was worried in your other post where you said you couldn't look at the comparisons.\\nWith MS, you need to be as proactive as you can. It is a tough balance to stay educated without overwhelming ourselves. It is lots harder when newly diagnosed. We all remember the fear and anxiety.

My best friend also had an AVM removed by a specialist at the same hospital and probably the same neurosurgeon! (2015 @ 50yrs old) She had the AVM all her life and no doctor would touch it! But, it finally ruptured and had emergency surgery and it saved her life. She has made close to a full recovery (miraculously). However, they also found a pseudo tumor that causes her some issues, but it is inoperable and all they can do it watch it and hope that it doesn't cause any serious problems.\\nI'm sorry your husband was left with disabilities. My friend's recovery was definitely a miracle.\\nI am 48 and was diagnosed in 2012. I have been on and off Copaxone since. No issues with the drug at all. Sometimes, I just like to take a break from it because I know that all DMD's lower your immune system. I have relapsing remitting and so far, I have no progression or legions. However, I was hospitalized Oct-Nov and in a medically induced coma for some of that time for an unexplained virus and my body was not responding to treatment. I made a full recovery, but the first week of Dec, when I was released, I fell and broke my pelvis in 2 places and fractured 2 vertebrae!\\nI am fully recovered from the pelvic fractures and the vertebrae are almost healed but are causing disc problems and sciatica, so while I can walk and drive, I still have a lot of pain and numbness in my back that radiates down my right leg and both of my feet are numb and tingling. I am seeing my neurologist tomorrow to see if the numbness and tingling in my feet is my back problem or an MS issue. It's hard to tell!

He lost all right side vision, but a surprising problem is that after the surgery he can\\'t read . This is an intelligent, college educated man who suddenly can\\'t read a kindergarten book. I don\\'t know if not being able to read or not being able to drive is the worse for him.\\nYes I am retired on disability also. I worked at SRS. I worked w/o any major problems for 15 years after dx (with disclosure to any/everyone), but ended up with a supervisor that did not want anyone with MS on his crew . I started having fatigue and memory problems (MS related as a direct result of the stress that he had me under).\\nThe site doctor called my supervisor and had him on speaker when I was there on a return to work visit, and the supervisor said point blank that since there were no jobs for me that it would be in my best interest to retire. Otherwise I would lose my job. I had too much time vested to loss it because of an ignorant power hungry you know what . This was in 2006.\\nI had LTD on my job and they too required me to file for SSDI. As it turned out it was a blessing in disguise to NOT be working. Prior to the AVM my husband was insulin dependant diabetic and has had more low blood sugar episodes than I can count. I have had to go to his job to get him numerous times and have had to call the EMTs to revive him enough times that they recognize him around town, not even talking about all of the times I was able to get his sugar up by myself. There is NO WAY that I could have cared for him and worked too.\\nON drove my MS dx, and I started on Avonex. I took it off and on for about 8 years before I just quit it. Since I have a true needle phobia that was not the best med for me but at the time all of the DMDs were injections. Yeah I did well on it, but the stress of the weekly injections was more than I cared to endure. When Gilenya was approved I started it, and took it faithfully for about 5 years. Then I developed too many severe side effects and simply stopped taking it. My neuro would prefer that I be on a DMD but I would prefer to have a QOL that doesn\\'t involve side effects - especially when they make me feel so much worse than I do without the meds.\\nI just realized that I have been retired for 12 years! It was rough at first not working, but then I got married and that has provided me with plenty of distractions . I also have an almost 7 yo granddaughter that made plans today to spend the night with me next week. I do volunteer work, work the media room at my church once a week and have a regular farm to tend to (fruit trees and veg plots, chickens, barn cats - just had a new kitten show up a week ago - and yard dogs - had a stray puppy show up 3 weeks ago that moved in and he is pure puppy) so I stay too busy now days to miss working.\\nAs somebody else said \"It is a good life and I even get paid to do the things that I want to do\" (well, as much as I am able to).

The results are important in that they confirm that the best predictor we have of having a second attack of MS is the presence of local synthesised oligoclonal IgG (immunoglobulin G) bands in the CNS (central nervous systems). This test is done on the spinal fluid and is one of the reasons why I prefer to make the diagnosis of MS with the help of spinal fluid analysis. Although you can make the diagnosis of MS without a lumbar puncture, and spinal fluid analysis, you are less likely to be misdiagnosed as having MS when you have a MS mimic with spinal fluid analysis...\\n\"I am also in the camp that accepts that OCBs are an important part of the MS pathology and are driving MS disease progression. These OCBs are highly selected antibodies and there is a large body of evidence emerging to support the hypothesis that OCBs are pathogenic and responsible for driving many aspects of the MS pathology, in particular the gray matter lesions in the cortex. This is why in the future we may need to clear the CNS of OCBs if want to prevent the delayed non-relapsing secondary progressive phase of the disease.\"\\n\"Does this have relevance for pwMS? Yes, if I had MS I would want to know if I had OCBs. The latter are part of the diagnostic criteria and provide prognostic information. You can never have enough information about your disease. I predict that we are about to enter a phase where we try different treatments to get rid of the OCBs, i.e. treatments to eliminate the plasma cells from the CNS of MSers.

When I was first diagnosed 5 years ago, it was the scariest time in my life. As I sat in the hospital (after being admitted from the ER because they didn\\'t know what was going on with my double vision) at 3 am, I remember sobbing in the family room on the phone with my mom and she just gave me scripture after scripture and it was a balm to my soul. I know God heard my cries and continues to hear my prayers.\\nWhen I was given the diagnosis a few months later and the dr told me to start researching which drug I wanted to go on, I was hesitant. All those side effects! It was daunting and scary. But I prayed about it and researched it and it was on these boards that someone told me something that, although I may not remember the exact wording, the message still resonates with me. They said that \"While you can go off the medication at any time you wish, you can never go back in time to start it earlier.\" That was, to me, my answer to prayer about whether or not I should go on a DMD.\\nNow, 5 years later, I have been on Tecfidera since then. I just turned 40 years old. I still play volleyball on a competitive league. I can keep up with my husband and two girls (7 & 9). I have had no new relapses and no new lesions. I still work full-time and even started a side job doing photography.\\nI don\\'t know what my life would look like without the DMD. Maybe it would look the same. But I keep telling myself that I\\'m not taking the Tecfidera to feel good NOW. I\\'m taking the Tecfidera to feel good when I\\'m in my 50\\'s, 60\\'s, 70\\'s and beyond. That I can still enjoy being active, that I can enjoy retirement with my husband, that my quality of life later will be what I hope it to be.\\nI know that tomorrow is not a guarantee, but for me, I felt like this was something I could do to protect my future.\\nNow, I want to be honest with you--the side effects of the drugs. Yes, I have thinner hair than I used to--but I look at my mom (and dad!) and wonder if that\\'s the drugs or just genetics. I have the occasional flushing which I wonder if has caused or triggered what I think might be rosacea. I am battling cavities, but again, is it the medication or just the way my teeth are? As far as the brain disease and the scarier side effects--the drs are aware of them--which is why they test you for signs of them. And if your blood and/or urine tests start looking out of the ordinary, they watch you and test more often.\\nI encourage you to continue to pray for wisdom in this decision. I also encourage you to look at the message boards regarding the different types of medications and side effects (just remember that there are thousands more people who are on the medication who DON\\'T have side effects). And if you see something that you would like better than what your dr is suggesting, then talk to your dr about it.\\nUltimately, as you know, it\\'s YOUR decision! I wish you all the best!', 'DMD?\\nSheerwill,\\nYou have me by 1 year. My MS kicked in about 31 years ago with left foot drop. I was very active, healthy, played lots of sports, and was a 5K runner. But unlike you, I did not ask for God’s help, was grateful for what abilities I still had and have today, and did take my doctor’s recommendations.\\nTook DMDs for many years, on and off Avonex, Copaxon, Rebif, and hated them all. Also took several pills, Carbamazapine, Nuerontin, prednisone, and others and never liked taking pills even aspirin for a headache. Do not like shots or side effects although they usually diminish with time. Not a big vitamin/supplement person either, prefer to eat well to get required nutrients.\\nI always read the fine print and details of any studies and was not impressed with any of the stats, the % improvement seemed marginal at best. I honestly don’t think that any of the DMDs helped, but they did reduce my quality of life. So, I quit taking any about 8 years ago and did not notice a change, just felt better.\\nHowever, I did start taking Rituxan (predecessor of Ocrevus) just over 4 years ago and my progression has seemed to have slowed a bit. I never noticed any improvement while on a DMD. I believe that there are 2 treatments today that are the most effective, but you really need to do your own research and not just go with what the drug companies and all the bleeding hearts tell you. Note also that even in the scientific studies a lot of patients experience improvements due to the placebo effect.\\n1. Rituxan/Ocrevus have some positive results as I just stated\\n2. The recent study and post on using your own harvested blood stem cells to reboot your immune system. (but seems targeted toward younger population with RRMS, not for us older/progressives)\\nMy suggestion is to talk to your doctor about Rituxan/Ocrevus if you haven’t already. The results of the studies are much better than any of the DMDs. But you probably won’t find any studies on Rituxan for MS because it’s not financially beneficial for the drug company to do one since they are pushing the more expensive Ocrevus.\\nI will be 61 this year, still walk with/without a cane, have many common symptoms, weakness/muscle atrophy on my left side, pain, stiffness, tingling, numbness, heat sensitivity, intense itching at times (uncommon), and others. I have a technical/engineering background and taught middle school sciences for 12 years, which I am stating only to let you know that I do try to look at things critically and make informed decisions.\\nBest of luck (and God’s will)\\nScott', \"Sheerwill,\\nMy experience has been so similar to yours that I felt I needed to respond! I had very minor and intermittent symptoms over the years, starting with double vision in my early 20's. My only other real symptoms were some hand and foot numbness and bladder issues. I wasn't diagnosed until 2013 when I was 49, and went on Aubagio at that time, since my neuro thought it would give me a better prognosis for the long term.\\nSince my diagnosis I am much more aware of balance issues and instability walking than I was aware of prior. Even though I would love to wear cute shoes, I recognize that I'm much more stable in a lace up running shoe. I have sprained my ankle three times in a 6 month period, so I have just had to learn to slow myself down and really be careful where I walk.\\nI haven't had too many side effects from the Aubagio at all. I have lost a lot of hair, but it's so fine and thin anyway, that I don't think it's that noticeable. I haven't noticed that it's caused any excess weight gain, I would attribute that to being able to move and exercise less. Unfortunately, long walks are much harder on me a lot of the time than they used to be.\\nI have also taken a good supply of vitamins, including all of the ones you mentioned. I take a lot of Vitamin D, and my numbers whenever they're checked are all in the right range. If I were you, I would not hesitate to follow what your doctor suggests as far as using a DMD. Aubagio has been fine for me, where I was not a candidate for Gilenya, and couldn't tolerate Tecfidera.\\nBest of luck to you!\", \"Originally posted by gargantua View Post\\nHi SheerWill,\\nAfter a long history of dancing with an MS diagnosis I've recently been recommended to take meds.

Just wanted to let you know, We Get It.\\nWishing you well', 'HI, Hanna!\\nI found a lot of great information on this site theconsciouslife.com It advocates an anti-inflammatory lifestyle. MS is fulla inflammation, which as you know causes discomfort, flare ups and symptoms. Keep reading all you can, and try not to get scared. I began with a MS for dummies book. The more knowledge, the more power. I agree with journaling and also counseling helps me. Maybe you can find other teens with MS to communicate with. That would really help.', 'Welcome to MSWorld, Jenn! Glad you were milling around here to read others experiences and to finally share yours with us. Yes, MS is a MyStery! Most of us have a certain amt of symptoms in common, but when you think of our complex brain workings and numerous neuro pathways, it a wonder that some of us share commonalities, yet many of us do not.\\nIt\\'s good to hear you are on Tsyabri soon after being diagnosed. I\\'m a firm believer that hitting it with \"bigger guns\" in the beginning will help in the long run. Me? I was not so lucky, but for others, I\\'m glad we have so many better choices now.\\nIt\\'s perfectly normal to have differing thoughts creep in about your future. We all share in that. Thanks for sharing your story and hope we can be of more help when you need it.\\nWishing you the best too!', \"Hi Jenn and welcome!\\nThank you for sharing your story with us.\\nWishing you great success with Tysabri, as it seems to be helping so many.\\nIf you have any questions, just ask and we'll be glad to help, if we can.\\nAlso, when you need to vent, we'll be here to listen and understand.\\nTake Care\", 'Hi Jenn,\\nYour MS diagnosis was so shocking for you, as it would be for anyone. I am so sorry. The lack of empathy your neuro demonstrated was shocking, too. Forgive him if he is too busy to be more human; time will change him.\\nBut I give him lots of credit for starting you on Tysabri. IMO, that is precisely the right DMT for the sudden and dramatic symptoms you described. I\\'m sure other factors entered into the treatment choice, also. He may lack bedside manners but he doesn\\'t seem to be lacking treatment skills.\\nAlong with many others, I believe it is best to hit MS early and hard. Tysabri does that brilliantly. There are many testimonies to that effect right here at MS World.\\nMathematically speaking, it is more probable that you will stabilize and recover function on Tysabri than most other DMTs. And, with a great deal fewer side effects than other DMTs, too. Many taking Tysabri experience few or no side effects. My wife was one of those. She was on Tysabri from 2002 until 2017, except for one year when it was not available. She transitioned to Ocrevus last year and continues doing very well.\\nJenn, lots of MSers have taken Tysabri for many years with great success. As the MS symptoms you have been experiencing slow down you will begin recovery and you will begin feeling better. Your brain will begin figuring work-arounds of damaged areas (lesions) using something commonly termed \"neurological reserve\".\\nThe beauty of Tysabri is that it is so effective in slowing or halting inflammation and new lesions that it gives your brain opportunity to recover and develop new pathways using neurological reserve.\\nWarning... If the brain exhausts its neurological reserve, that is when someone with RRMS transitions from relapsing-remitting MS to secondary progressive MS. Please understand that point, won\\'t you? Therefore, it is critically important to get on the most effective DMT as soon as possible; delaying the progression of MS as long as possible or, even halting progression.\\nI believe you will recover far, far, more than what your present symptoms may suggest to you. Years ago for a brief period, I spoon fed my wife and helped her with every bodily function. Today, she leads Silver Sneakers and Yoga classes at the local YMCA. We believe she is able to do that because she was fortunate enough to get on a very effective DMT, Tysabri, during trials and stay on it for 15 years. She never got a new lesion on Tysabri and her brain obviously figured ways around the damaged areas.\\nTysabri is the same choice you and your neuro made, so congratulations! I believe you will have the same results, too! Believe it, girl, you are going to get better...much, much, better and become the dynamite grandmother you will surely be!', \"Jenn1976,\\nWelcome! I, too, am recently diagnosed and have found this forum so helpful. I start a DMT very soon. I know what you mean about thoughts of what could be, creeping in. It's hard to stop those thoughts!\\nBest of luck to you!\", 'Thank you, and good luck with whatever med you get on!', \"Thank you, everyone!\\nI appreciate everyone sharing their thoughts and responses with me.\\nSide note: The original neurologist did not put me on Tysabri. He handed me a script for Copaxine and sent me on my way. I didn't try the Copaxine because I knew the neurologist did not care about my MS and was not up-to-date on treatment options. Luckily, I knew better and immediately found a proper MS doctor who went over my options and thoroughly answered questions I had.\", 'Jenn, good for you finding the right neuro! I agree with the info others have given you. I have been on Tysabri since 10/ 2006 and have now been getting infused every 56 days (instead of 28) for a few years.\\nI did want to add that somewhere between my 4th and 6th infusion I saw some of my symptoms start to abate. My MRIs have shown no new or active lesions and I have led a good QOL. I am now 69 years of age I was diagnosed 1988.\\nGood luck and best wishes!', 'Originally posted by Seasha View Post\\n...\\nIt\\'s good to hear you are on Tsyabri soon after being diagnosed.

I was not so lucky, but for others, I\\'m glad we have so many better choices now.\\n...\\nWelcome, Jenn. I agree with Seasha. I was also not so lucky. It took almost 2 years for me to be dx, so no meds at all then. Next, I started on Betaseron, which, for me, was not effective. However, my neuro didn\\'t take me off and try something different. Then, after switching to an MS Specialist, she put me on Copaxone, which worked well for me for a lot of years. The newer meds weren\\'t out at that time, but, it may have been a good idea to switch to the \"bigger guns\" after they were.\\nBut, the past year or two or three, I\\'ve begun to notice a lot of decline in my mobility and stamina. I\\'m 55; have had MS for 16 years. Probably transitioning from RRMS to SPMS.\\nI hope your current symptoms will go away. They often do.

I just wanted to say that I have had 4 (or so??) MRIs in the past and nothing has ever shown up as \"MS Specific\", although everything points to MS. The neurologist said sooner or later the spots will show up. I\\'m not sure I like that mindset, but it is what it is.\\nOh yes, she also said she would have already diagnosed me with MS if it weren\\'t for the McDonald Criteria. That was about 7 years ago (???), the first time I saw a neurologist.\\nI have taken breaks from doctors over the years - this most recent break has been a few years I think. I get frustrated and figure what\\'s the point anyway if I am not going to take their drugs? At least not yet. I\\'m ready now to go back and try again. We\\'ll see!!! My symptoms have steadily been worse and worse, and I am nearly convinced it\\'s PPMS. My GP has done \\'fifty billion\\' tests, twice [with about 4 years in between the tests], and still has not found anything.\\nIt\\'s a bit humbling to go from super active, in shape, \"healthy\", etc, to needing a cane, needing a wheel chair at times, and all of the other things that go wrong with me. The cognitive side is the worse. I say, put me in a wheel chair for the rest of my life, but please leave my brain alone!\\nI just take each day as it comes and am thankful for all of the love and support I have.

The frontal lobes are extremely vulnerable to injury due to their location at the front of the cranium, proximity to the sphenoid wing and their large size.

From what you have written the most important exercise for you would be core strengthening. Our core body strength is needed to support the spine as well s other benefits. A Physical Therapist is a really good place to start for an evaluation and help in rebuilding your Core Body Strength. Many of the exercises can be done on your bed but it's important to make those exercises life long.\\nIt is possible to see improvement through Physical Therapy although it takes time and commitment on your part.

Only a neurologist would be qualified to determine that.\\nWhat we all can do is offer you our support, understanding, and knowledge. We can also help walk you through the diagnostic process, and point you in the direction of symptomatic management (you don't even need a MS dx). I only hope you'll give us all a chance.

(I have been one of them and managed to get the right help just in time.) But, there is still hope on the other side. Please don't give up.\\nThere are advances happening all the time with MS research. One of the most exciting going on right now is remylinating the nerves. Not all that long ago it wasn't even considered a possibility. Now it is and several different compounds are in clinical trials right now. The one in stage 2 clinical trials is called Anti-lingo. Once they can do that, it will stop MS in it's tracks and halt any further destruction/ progression. Whatever damage that may have already been done will also improve, because nerve signals will once again be able to travel again down those nerve pathways.\\nThe other is stem cell research. The ones showing exciting promise right now for MS are mesenchymal and neural stem cells. (In fact, both were just used back to back on a legendary hockey player, Gordie Howe, who had suffered a major stroke with miraculous results! I can't imagine the possible implications this may have for repairing neurons and restoring function in MS as well.)\\nThey are also getting closer to figuring out how to test potential MS therapies in a petri dish. They'd basically clone human MS cells and use them to determine whether a therapy was effective or not in MS. That would be huge. No more waiting until potential therapies went through years of clinical trials. They are also looking at ways to repair any damage that has already occurred. Great news to the ears of anyone with progressive MS.\\nPlease do whatever you need to so you can climb out of the despair you are in right now. Call the number Seasha and Mamabug provided for starters. Then, seek out some professional help and don't give up trying to find out what is wrong until you have answers! Only then can you can receive proper treatment, to hopefully turn things around. It would be even more devastating to your loved ones if you took your own life and then, after an autopsy (required for any suspicious death), whatever is going on turned out to be no where near as bad as you had thought it was.\\nAnd as you've been reading this, you might be thinking I don't have progressive MS. I do. Or it can't be that bad or that I have a lot of understanding and support from people surrounding me. Neither is true. No one gets it, not even the doctors. Just tonight someone close to me (who should've known better) said something stupid and very hurtful. But I still wake up and fight this every day.

I was diagnosed about a year and a half ago. I still look and feel quite healthy, but had a new lesion on recent MRI, despite being on Copaxone. Very few people who know me know I have MS. But this new lesion has motivated me to clean up my diet, just in case that will make a difference. I’m doing Wahls for now, but I’m spending many hours every week consuming research about different diets and on lipid metabolism as it relates to MS. I digress. Eating the way I do now is inconvenient and difficult to explain to people. I have told a few more people about my MS, a few close friends. I still don’t want the world to know. I don’t want my employer to know, even though it wouldn’t be a problem. Are any of you currently (or previously) struggling with the conundrum of who to tell and when?

MS wasn\\'t dx-ed until almost 2 years later. By then, there had been more than one \"possible\" diagnosis, multiple flares, ambulance rides, ER visits and hospitalizations. It was a relief to, finally, be able to give a \"reason\" for unexplained symptoms.\\nPerhaps, if you don\\'t wish to explain MS when asked about your diet, you can just say that you are exploring options that can help with some of your \"health problems\". If questioned further, it is really none of their business. You can just politely tell them that you don\\'t wish to talk about additional details now. Then, change the subject.', \"I struggle with this same thing!

I feel like many people are skeptical because they think gluten free is a huge fad.

I stopped in there after my PCP (who told me he does \"deal with MS\" and gave me a 10 day course of oral steroids that essentially did nothing for me!) The My Clinic nurse was fabulous, even though they\\'re not set up to see someone with MS; she went above and beyond in taking care of me (spending an hour!) and \"tried\" her best to get me in \"urgently\" at Waddell - the best she could do was get me an appt. in mid-September.

While going to the bathroom I became extremely nauseas, lightheaded and dizzy. I stumbled out of the bathroom and almost fell over. I felt weak, extremely hot and sweaty. My gf was immediately concerned by the way I looked. She said I was extremely pale. She felt my forehead and said that my skin was freezing and clammy (the opposite of how I felt inside). I sat down with my heart racing and shallow breathing. My hands became extremely tingly. I took my temperature which read 94.4. Now the skin on my hands felt as though it was vibrating.\\nI was ready to go to the ER after about ten mins of these strange symptoms but then it started to subside. My temp gradually rose back to normal. After doing some research online I can only assume that it was a case of autonomic dysreflexia. My neuro agreed that this could be the cause due to where my lesion was on my spine after my first attack. I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced this and if so perhaps you can shed some light on this condition and how frequent/infrequently it occurs.\\nHi AntRM - welcome to MS World!\\nI am not very familiar with autonomic dysreflexia (although I did look it up after reading your post).\\nThe symptoms sound kind of scary. From what I have read, it seems that there are preventative measures that can be taken, and conditions to be aware of such as bladder infections or bowel obstructions, pressure sores, hemorrhoids, etc - anything that might cause pain or discomfort below the level of the spinal lesion.\\nIn any case, hopefully for you this doesn't occur anymore.\\nMaybe other members have experienced this also, and will respond.\\nTake Care\", 'Hi AntRM,\\nMy opinion? What you experienced was due to the alcohol. Multiple Sclerosis is a disease of the Central Nervous System(CNS). Alcohol affects the CNS. Some people have no problem drinking alcohol when having MS and some do. When I was diagnosed with MS this was one of the many things my Neurologist discussed with me.\\nMuch of what you experienced is what happens to me (to a lesser degree) if I drink, sometimes as little as a few sips to half a drink. For this reason I rarely drink alcohol.\\nSomething to consider: Many medications cannot and should not be combined with alcohol. Drinking alcohol with some medications can have serious side effects.', \"Thank you both for your replies 😀\\nI don't drink as often as I used to especially after being diagnosed and needless to say after this experience I'm staying away from it all together. There is a strong possibility it was a reaction between the alcohol and Meds (Copaxone 40 mg, adderal 7.5 mg, and buspar 10 mg) I guess I won't have any more proof unless it happens again under different circumstances.\", \"Originally posted by Breedough View Post\\nHello all,\\nMy name is Bree.

Bafiertam (pronounced bah”feer’tam) is similar to Tecfidera® and Vumerity® but has a distinct chemical structure. This therapy is now available for prescription.\\n>Relapsing forms of MS includes people with clinically isolated syndrome (an initial episode of neurological symptoms), relapsing-remitting MS, and active secondary progressive MS. People with active secondary progressive MS have had progression of disability but still experience acute relapses or new MRI activity.\\n>Although their exact mechanisms of action are not known, fumarate therapies are thought to modulate the immune response underlying MS to be less inflammatory, and may have antioxidant properties that could be protective against damage to the brain and spinal cord.\\n>Because of its similarity to Tecfidera, Bafiertam’s approval was based largely on the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy for Tecfidera and “bioavailability” studies in healthy subjects comparing dimethyl fumarate to Bafiertam. Twice-daily Tecfidera was shown in clinical trials to significantly reduce relapses and disease activity on MRIs, and in one trial it reduced progression of disability.\\n>People prescribed Bafiertam will take a lower dose for one week, and then a maintenance dose of two capsules taken by mouth twice a day.\\n>The price of Bafiertam has been announced as $69,480 per year. The actual cost to individuals will depend on the provisions of their insurance coverage and the degree to which they will be eligible for programs designed to assist with out-of-pocket costs.\\nMore info:\\nhttps://www.nationalmssociety.org/Ab...ethyl-Fumarate)', 'Thanks for this information, Kimba!

ZEPOSIA® (ozanimod) is a prescription medicine used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease, in adults.\\nIn two separate clinical studies, ZEPOSIA was more effective at reducing relapses and new or enlarging lesions (T2) than a leading injectable medicine (Avonex).\\nThe progression of physical disability was measured, too.\\nhttps://multiplesclerosis.net/weekly...920-study.html', 'Early use of high efficacy disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) is more effective than the traditional approach — that of an escalating treatment regimen — at delaying disability progression in people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), a real-life study from Italy reports.\\nPeople later moving to more aggressive treatment also appeared to benefit less from it than those treated intensively from the start, its researchers said.\\nThe traditional and most frequently used approach in treating RRMS supports the use of moderately effective DMTs, which generally have good safety profiles. Patients then move to higher-efficacy DMTs as needed, according to disease progression.\\nWhile high-efficacy DMTs for RRMS have a consistently superior effect on disease activity than the traditional first-line MS DMTs, they are usually associated with greater risks. For this reason, they are often reserved for high-risk patients with poor prognosis.\\nHowever, increasing data suggest that RRMS patients may benefit more from upfront use of the most efficacious DMTs — an approach called early intensive therapy, or EIT — than from the standard escalating regimen (ESC). EIT may manage the disease in its early, inflammatory phase, preventing irreversible damage and long-term disability.\\nResearchers in Italy evaluated the long-term disability trajectories of a large group of RRMS patients treated with EIT or a standard escalating regimen in a real-life setting.\\n“Whether patients initiating high-efficacy DMTs as their 1st therapy derive a greater long-term benefit on disability progression than those who start with the 1st-line agents and then switch to high-efficacy DMTs, remains a matter of debate,” Iaffaldano said.\\nA total of 2,652 RRMS patients, each with at least five years of follow-up, a first visit within three years of disease onset, and three or more disability assessments after starting a DMT, were selected from the Italian MS Registry.\\nPatients were treated and followed at 62 MS centers in that country, and their disability was measured through the expanded disability status scale (EDSS).\\nThe EIT group included 365 patients treated with Gilenya (fingolimod, by Novartis), Tysabri (natalizumab, by Biogen), Novantrone (mitoxantrone), Lemtrada (alemtuzumab, by Sanofi-Genzyme), Ocrevus (ocrelizumab, by Genentech), or Mavenclad (cladribine, by EMD Serono) as a first disease-modifying treatment. (EMD Serono is known as Merck KGaA outside North America.)\\nThe ESC group included 2,337 patients who moved to a high-efficacy DMT after at least one year of treatment with Copaxone (glatiramer acetate, by Teva Pharmaceuticals), various interferons, azathioprine (sold as Azasan and Imuran), Aubagio (teriflunomide, by Sanofi Genzyme), or Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate, by Biogen).\\nThe effectiveness of these two treatment approaches was then assessed by looking at mean annual changes in disability, via patients’ EDSS scores, for up to 10 years, as compared with scores before DMT initiation.\\nTo help ensure valid comparisons, patients in the escalating treatment (ESC) group were matched as best as possible at baseline (therapy start) by characteristics like age, sex, EDSS scores, etc., to those in the early intensive treatment (EIT) group. In total, the researchers looked at data covering 365 pairs of matching patients.\\nThese people had mild to moderate disability, with a mean EDSS score of 2.61 in the EIT group and 2.63 in the ESC group, before starting a first DMT. Patients were followed by a median of 8.5 years (range of 6.5–11.7 years).\\nAll in the escalating regimen moved to a higher-efficacy DMT after a median of 5.1 years (range: 3.1–8.4 years). Most (93.11%) had started with an injectable DMT (such as the interferons and Copaxone), before escalating to Tysabri (42.98%) or Gilenya (38.84%).\\nAmong EIT patients, the most common first high-efficacy DMT used was Tysabri (40.77%), followed by Novantrone (38.84%).\\nSignificantly higher annual EDSS changes were seen in ESC group patients than in those on the EIT regimen at each follow-up year, indicating faster disability progression in people on the standard escalating regimen.\\nNotably, EDSS score differences between the two groups increased from 0.10 at one year to 0.30 at five years, and to 0.67 at 10 years.\\n“Our results indicate that EIT strategy is more effective than ESC strategy in controlling disability progression and the effect tends to increase over time despite patients in the ESC group escalated to a higher-efficacy DMT,” the researchers wrote.\\n“This could be due to a more potent effect on disability progression of the high-efficacy DMTs in the early years of the disease or alternatively, to the longer exposure to them,” Iaffaldano said.\\nHe noted further studies are needed to confirm these results, and to establish the long-term safety of the EIT approach. Still, these findings may help clinicians making treatment decisions, “in particular in the cases of naive patients [those with no prior treatment] with poor prognosis factors at the onset of disease,” Iaffaldano added.\\nhttps://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.c...al-life-study/', 'Thanks, Marco\\nInteresting study.

Or is is simply a question. Of administration. I took rebif for some time so injections don’t scare me. But long infusions are a hassle.\\nOfatumumab was compared head to head with Aubagio can was shown to be a superior medication (on average).\\nIt's impossible to know if it's a better drug than Ocrelizumab, but here are a few thoughts:\\n- Ocrelizumab is humanized, while Ofatumumab is fully human. This should decrease the chance of developing neutralizing antibodies. Developing neutralizing antibodies is even a bigger problem with Rituximab that is chimeric in nature. Treatment induced anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) were detected in 2 of 914 (0.2%) KESIMPTA-treated patients; no patients with treatment enhancing or neutralizing ADAs were identified.\\n- a number of patients report breakthrough activity before their next 6 month Ocrelizumab infusion. These people may be experiencing early b-cell repopulation. With monthly dosing it's unlikely that b-cells would ever repopulate.\\n- as you mentioned, Ofatumumab is a self-injected so infusions are no longer required. I'm a difficult IV stick so this medication would remedy that problem for me.\\n- all three b-cell depleting therapies bind slightly differently to the CD20 cells so one could work better for you than the others.\\n- there's recent research that shows Ocrelizumab may negate the effects of vaccines. With Rituximab and Ocrelizumab, timing can be used to try to maximize and potential benefit. With a monthly injection it could reduce the effectiveness of vaccines even further and is mentioned in the prescribing information. This could hinder the effectiveness of a covid vaccine.\\n- normally Ocrelizumab is infused with steroids and other premedications. These additional medications are not necessary for Ofatumumab injections.\\n- the side effect profile of each medication is different so you may tolerate one better than another. Upper respiratory infections are more likely in Ofatumumab so that could be a covid concern.\\n- with 12 injections you have more opportunities for medication reactions. Many people feel side effects after Ocrelizumab infusions, but that's only twice per year. If you have injection reactions (greater than 10%) every dose you could end up with more days of recovery.\\n- it's worth noting that, like Rituximab, the dosing of Ofatumumab for MS patients is much lower than for cancer patients\\n- Ocrelizumab infusions of 2.5 hours have been approved in Europe and will probably be approved here in the US before long.\", \"I've been on Copax for 18 months and am starting have noticeable fat-loss spots in some injection areas.

My prayers to you and your family!\", \"I thought this was a helpful article explaining how certain drugs are given their names:\\nMaking Sense of Monoclonal Antibodies\\nThe amount of available monoclonal antibodies (–mabs) has increased in the past few years, and their targeted nature is treating everything from cancer to high cholesterol.\\nUnfortunately, –mabs are a source of confusion for many pharmacists. Their names are long and complicated, and they all sound the same.\\nAs it turns out, –mabs aren’t too bad once you get to know them. They’re named based on an established process, and a –mab’s name actually tells you quite a lot about it.\\nLet’s break down the nomenclature and discuss a few clinical pearls.\\nRule 1\\nThese drugs all end in the suffix “–mab,” so you should know the type of drug when you see it.\\nRule 2\\nThe 1 or 2 letters preceding –mab tell you the source of the antibody.\\nThese drugs are made by collecting antibodies from some source, which are then distilled down until there are many, many copies of the same antibody. The source is usually human, mouse, or some combination of the 2.\\nHere's a quick rundown of the most common prefixes:\\n* -o-: mouse (all mouse)\\n* -xi-: chimeric (part human, part\\nnonhuman)\\n* -zu-: humanized (mostly human,\\npart nonhuman)\\n* -u-: human (all human)\\nRule 3\\nThe 1 or 2 letters before the source tell you where in the body the –mab works. Here’s a quick list of the most common targets:\\n* -c(i)-: circulatory system\\n* -k(i)-: interleukin\\n* -l(i)-: immune system\\n* -t(u)-: tumor\\nThat’s not an exhaustive list, but it covers most of the –mabs you’ll encounter.\\nRule 4\\nThere’s no set nomenclature before the target; drug developers are just asked to provide something that flows well with the rest of the name.\\nOne last thing to mention about nomenclature: how biosimilars are named is still up for debate. The current recommendation by the FDA is to include a suffix of 4 random letters.\\nBecause this is a new area, there aren’t many examples. The first biosimilar –mab currently on the US market is infliximab-dyyb (Inflectra).\\nClinical Pearls\\nNow that we’ve covered the nomenclature, how can we use it to our advantage?\\nFor starters, if you encounter a new –mab, you can at least generally determine where it works in the body. If you see alemtuzumab, you know it works on tumors (-tu-) and is derived from a humanized source (-zu-). If you didn’t know evolocumab is a PCSK9 inhibitor, you’d at least know the drug works in the circulatory system (-c-) and is fully human (-u-).\\nSecond, the source of the antibody can be used to predict the risk of infusion reactions.\\nEven if they’re from a fully human source, –mabs are foreign proteins, so there’s a relatively high risk of infusion reactions during administration. The risk of reaction is highest with the first couple of infusions and the most foreign source, so a chimeric –mab that’s 50% mouse- and 50% human-derived will generally have a higher reaction risk than a fully human –mab.\\nHere’s a quick rundown of infusion reaction risk based on –mab type:\\n* –momab (highest risk)\\n* –ximab\\n* –zumab\\n* –mumab (lowest risk)\\nThere are exceptions, of course. The recently-approved daratumumab (Darzalex) has an astounding 48% risk of infusion reaction.\\nInfusion reactions can be somewhat mitigated by premedication. Often, a combination of acetaminophen and diphenhydramine (plus or minus a steroid like methylprednisolone) are given 30 minutes before infusion.\\nManaging infusion reactions usually starts with stopping the infusion and administering IV steroids and/or diphenhydramine. From there, the infusion can be restarted at half the rate it was running previously. If patients react again, they most likely shouldn’t be rechallenged; it’s time to consider another therapeutic option.\\nFinally, don’t forget –mabs have other side effects not related to infusion reactions. Although they’re highly targeted by design, there are still risks. For example, trastuzumab (Herceptin) is an antibody directed at the HER2 receptor used in certain breast and stomach cancers, and it has an up to 34% rate of cardiotoxicity. Meanwhile, bevacizumab (Avastin), an antibody directed at VEGF, can cause hypertension, proteinuria, and even GI perforation.\\nThis only scratches the surface of possibilities for –mabs. In certain areas like oncology, they’re becoming mainstays of treatment. The more we know about –mabs, the more we’ll be able to help our patients and the health care team.\\nhttps://www.pharmacytimes.com/contri...nal-antibodies\", 'Thank you!!\\nI have always wondered about this.

It seems Ocrevus would be easier to get approved through insurance. Rituxan is recommended for the type of inflammatory arthritis I am diagnosed with. Any information would be appreciated.\", 'Hi KatW,\\nOcrevus is specifically approved for MS. It is a humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (monoclonal antibody = made in a laboratory). It targets CD20 marker on B lymphocytes and is an immunosuppressive drug.\\nRituxan (Rituximab) is FDA approved for Rheumatoid Arthritis and used \"off label\" for MS. Rituxan is a chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody. It is a chemotherapy drug.\\nOcrevus binds to a different but overlapping region on B cells than Rituxan does. Since Ocrevus is derived mostly from human antibodies, it induces less of an immune response to foreign antigens. Ocrevus is thought to bind more to CD20 than Rituxan. For these reasons, it is thought to have a more favorable benefit to risk profile in MS.\\nThere are no published studies with Ocrevus for RA. So there\\'s no scientific data to determine how well it may or may not work for that condition.\\nThere are also no published studies that directly compare Ocrevus and Rituxan in treating MS.\\nOcrevus is associated with fewer infusion-related reactions because it is a humanized antibody. Studies of Ocrevus have revealed an increased risk of breast cancer, while the limited studies of Rituxan in MS did not reveal a similar risk.\\nInsurance companies may not cover \"off-label\" treatments used for MS, so depending on your insurance, you may need it prescribed for your RA.\\nRituxan is also used with Methotrexate in the treatment of RA. The dosing schedule may be different than for MS. I believe it may be more frequent, but that is something to ask your rheumatologist. Rituxan is usually prescribed for RA if you haven\\'t responded well to other treatments. (This is also sometimes the case with MS disease modifying therapies.)\\nYour rheumatologist might have more insight on that, and if feels this medication is warranted for you, can make a case to persuade your insurance company to cover it if there is a problem. My neurologist made a case for me when he prescribed a different drug (also used \"off-label\" for MS).\\nYour neurologist would most likely have your rheumatologist prescribe the medication for you if chosen to treat your RA as well. I hope they will work together to determine the best treatment and who should prescribe it for you.\\nBest of luck and please keep us updated.', \"Hi KatW,\\nAdditional information about prescribing Rituxan for Rheumatoid Arthritis:\\nRiituximab (Rituxan) is approved by\\nThe Food and Drug Administration in combination with Methotrexate for the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more TNF antagonist therapies.\\nIt is only approved as a second line therapy. This classification refers to a drug that may only be prescribed when other FDA-approved treatments fail or are not tolerated well by a patient. The MS drug Lemtrada has been given the same classification by the FDA. It is not prescribed before other appoved treatments fail.\\nIn another thread, you mentioned you are on Plaquenil, which is not a TNF therapy.\\nThe drugs in this class include Remicade (infliximab), Enbrel (etanercept), Humira (adalimumab), Cimzia (certolizumab pegol) and Simponi (golimumab).\\nWhile there are some cases where patients have been approved for a second line therapy before failing others first, the odds may not be in your favor.\\nSo your neurologist would more likely need prescribe it for your MS. Methotrexate would not be prescribed in combination with it, though.\\nFor RA, it is typically prescribed every six months, up to.every four months if needed. For MS, it's prescribed every six months. The dose is the same for both conditions, 1,000 mg.\\nWorth a discussion with your doctors if you'd like to consider taking this drug.\\nBest of luck!.\", \"Rituximab was never approved for MS because the patent was running out and wasn't worth the huge clinical trials investment.\\nDespite the release of Ocrelizumab, I remain on rituximab and have little reason to change. It's subdued previously active MS that 6 other medications could not. Rituximab has been on the market for many years and we have a lot of knowledge about its safety profile.\\nOcrelizumab, while similar, has already shown an increase in cancer rates unseen in rituximab. Why this is happening is not clearly understood. For me, the biggest reason to select Ocrelizumab over rituximab is the much lower rate of developing neutralizing antibodies. The lower rate is attributed to Ocrelizumab being humanized versus the chimeric nature of rituximab.\\nDosing is generally the same, but there's no set protocol for rituximab (since it's off-label). I now get 500 mg every 6 months which is fairly common in the MS/Rituximab community.\\nMany insurance companies readily approve rituximab because it's considerably cheaper than Ocrelizumab. Recently more insurance companies are even moving patients from rituximab to Truxima, a biosimilar medication.\\nI wish you well...\", 'Just curious if anyone has used this medication for prevention of migraine headaches?', 'I hope someone will be along soon, who can respond to your question.

If it ain't broke, don't fix it!\", '\"After age 65, continue or de-escalate DMT\\'\\nReally a great conversation starter because it is a question virtually all pwMS on a DMT will face at some point.\\nRisk - Reward balance with MS DMTs is possibly the most nuanced of any disease in existence. Individually, there are a ton of unique factors involved and as always with MS, one size decidedly DOES NOT fit all. But it is helpful to hear from each individual MSer how they approach the excellent question presented.\\n\"if it ain\\'t broke don\\'t fix it\" is very sound thinking, I believe. If someone is having good or great results on an effective DMT and suffering little or no side effects (as has been the case with the great majority of folks I have known personally taking Tysabri) then continuing that course seems prudent.\\nAt least two people here have recently mentioned they didn\\'t realize how crappy they felt on Avonex until they stopped taking it and went on Tysabri. So, two factors... the first is how crappy they felt with Avonex and the second is how much better they felt on Tysabri. My spouse, btw, agrees with that assessment.\\nHowever, what if she and they had only stopped taking Avonex? Would they have felt less crappy even though MS had the chance of becoming more active? No one knows for sure. I tend to take a mathematical probability approach to much of my thinking and comment about MS DMTs and issues around them. So, with that in mind, I express my opinion as follows...\\nI believe there is a high probability that most people taking Avonex would feel better not taking it because of the crappy side effects. But would their MS get worse if they stopped? Some may, especially younger than age 55 patients. Trials typically have an age cut off of 55 so we have little evidence, sometimes none, of effectiveness over age 55 in most MS DMTs. Please do not believe for a moment that the age cut-off is random; such thinking is terribly naive. Drug companies want their drug to look as good as possible so they omit populations which are likely to show decreasing effectiveness.\\nThe sparse effect most MS meds have in those younger than age 55 seems to disappear gradually over age 55 from what I understand. And, concerning disability progression, there is no evidence I have seen the CRAB drugs have much, if any, benefit regarding disability progression at any age.\\nIf you feel crappy on a CRAB drug while it has minimal impact on MS... well, I can understand why some people stop... they want to feel better. Certainly, over age 65, they could easily stop for a year to see how they felt and the very high probability is that stopping would have no effect on their MS. Likely, they would feel better minus the crappy side effects.\\nAn interjection here... the things Mamabug and others do... exercise, diet, etc. are in my opinion, likely to have as much effect, or more, than the CRAB drugs and certainly only help those who are taking CRAB drugs in combination with those things.\\nAlso, I\\'m a fan of LDN, ALA, and EGCG (not overdone with drinking green tea being the best form of EGCG). My guess is that those 3 things are more beneficial in MS than any of the CRAB drugs. I would love to see those 3 things trialed against CRAB drugs. IMO, all the CRAB drugs would largely disappear after that trial.\\nBut what about MS DMTs beyond the CRABs? Are there good reasons to continue taking them? Yes, I believe so. Tysabri has proven it preserves hand and arm function in SPMS. Most RRMS transitions into SPMS at some point in age and if/when you get there, if you are not walking as well you sure as heck want your hands and arms to work well.\\nEffective meds likely delay the transition from RRMS to SPMS, as do other things. Smokers, for example, transition to SPMS 7-8 years sooner than non-smokers, according to Sweden\\'s national registry of MSers.\\nIn conclusion, IMO, after age 65 most could stop CRAB drugs, experience no difference in MS and feel better minus those DMTs. But those having success on an effective DMT could very well benefit from continuing. JMHO.', 'Just wanted to expound on my ms journey. I have exercised most of my adult life.

I was on Avonex for 21 years. While my symptoms very slowly were escalating, my MRIs were stable so my neuro felt no need to change meds. In addition, my neuro felt that I could almost certainly stop Avonex when I hit 55.\\nThen I had what may or may not have been a relapse and when my neuro failed to return my calls, I felt I had no choice but to find a new doctor. I learned that my first doctor had not ordered certain MRIs in years (decades actually) and my new neuro, hearing my story, switched me to Tysabri. She said \"hell no\" when I asked about stopping drugs at 55.\\nI cannot say I felt much different after changing from Avonex to Tysabri. Less leg pain but that could have been a coincidence of timing. I will only be on Tysabri for one more year, then I will need to move on to something else.\\nMy feeling is different doctors have different approaches, which leads me to feel there is no one right way to go. My current doctor is clearly much more aggressive than my previous one. I have not found Tysabri to be the magic bullet however, and I admittedly am disappointed that DMTs clearly will be part of my life for many more decades.\\nAt 51, there really isn\\'t a decision to make and so I muddle through. Theoretically I am stable, but my symptoms are increasingly problematic. Still, I know in the grand scheme I am lucky. I trust my new doctor.

She didn't get an answer but here is what the NMSS says.\\nThe CDC recommends Shingrix, a non-live vaccine for the prevention of herpes zoster (shingles) and related complications. The vaccine, which is given in two doses separated by 2 to 6 months, is recommended over Zostavax® (the previously approved vaccine for shingles). Shingrix is approved for adults 50 years and older:\\nwhether or not they have had a prior episode of herpes zoster or have had a dose of Zostavax\\nwho have a chronic medical condition, unless there is a specific reason why the individual should not have it\\nwho are getting other adult vaccines such as influenza and pneumococcal (pneumonia) vaccines\\nNo studies of Shingrix have been done in people with MS. However, in two clinical studies with Shingrix, there was no increase in immune-mediated conditions.\\nThe CDC indicates that a person who is taking a low-dose immunosuppressive therapy or is going to begin taking an immunosuppressive medication can take Shingrix. It is very important to discuss this vaccine with the healthcare provider who is treating your MS to ensure that it is appropriate for you.\\nMy next Ocrevus infusion is in October - I will try to get this shot in early July.\", 'I am on Tysabri, but I have had my first dose of Shringrix and am looking to have my 2nd this week.

All rights reserved.\\n“Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that afflicts 400,000 people in the United States and more than 4 million individuals worldwide…\\nThree clinical trials of LDN in MS have been conducted and report that LDN increases the quality of life of MS patients.\\nCree et al concluded from a trial… LDN daily was a safe therapy that improved quality of life, whereas Sharafaddinzadeh et al reported safety after 17 weeks of treatment and recommended that longer trials be conducted to evaluate efficacy. Gironi et al studied primary progressive MS patients treated with LDN for 6 months and reported increased endogenous opioid levels in the patients and improved MS.\\nThe LDN treatment of patients with other autoimmune diseases including Crohn's disease and fibromyalgia has demonstrated safety and efficacy of the therapy.\\nA major symptom of MS is fatigue, which is one of the many characteristics that patients seek to alleviate. Improvement in fatigue was cited in these clinical studies after LDN therapy, which suggests that there is a potential link between upregulated endogenous opioid systems and fatigue.\\nTo determine the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of LDN on fatigue, a retrospective analysis of MS patients prescribed LDN (3.5 mg orally, once daily) by physicians in the Department of Neurology at The Penn State Hershey Medical Center was undertaken… LDN was not prescribed to patients receiving daily chronic opioid medications. All patients were given the option of receiving LDN with the understanding that medication could be stopped if they experienced side effects.\\nSome patients already receiving disease-modifying therapy (DMT) when started on LDN continued the standard DMT along with adjunctive LDN. Evidence of major drug interactions was monitored but no interactions were reported.\\nThe medical records of 215 MS patients, aged 18 to 65 years, seen in the MS clinic for a 7-year period (January 01, 2005 to May 31, 2012) and prescribed 3.5 mg LDN, orally, once daily, served as the study group. The LDN was provided by a licensed compounding pharmacy and cost the patients between US $30 to $50 monthly.\\nPrescriptions for LDN were provided to 152 female (71%) and 63 male (29%) patients. The female to male ratio was 2.4:1 and more than 3 quarters of all patients had RRMS, a ratio similar to the prevalence cited in the United States. Clinically, 87% of the patients had RRMS and 10% had secondary progressive MS, with a mean disease duration of 10 years…\\nSeventy seven percent (n = 166) of patients taking LDN for any period of time did not report any side effects. Six percent of the patients had insomnia, whereas 5% of the patients had excessive dreams. There was no evidence of increased side effects related to other immunomodulators when combined with LDN.\\nNo abnormal laboratory results were noted. Of the 215 patients receiving LDN, 57 patients (26%) were hospitalized during the duration of this study; 48 of these patients were hospitalized for non-MS–related events such as infections. No patient was admitted to the hospital because of side effects of LDN.\\nMost of the MS patients began LDN therapy because of fatigue. Nearly 60% (n = 128) of patients receiving LDN for any period of time reported a reduction in fatigue with LDN therapy.\\nFifty of the 215 patients commented that LDN produced no relief from fatigue and 4 patients stated that LDN increased their fatigue levels.\\nRegarding their quality of life and the perception of LDN's effects on MS, 130 patients (60%) stated that LDN stabilized or improved their disease and 75% of the patients reported improved or stabilized quality of life.\\nNine patients reported that LDN reduced the quality of life, and 8% of the patients had the perception that their disease increased while on LDN but provided no details.\\nIn conclusion, this chart review focused on 215 MS patients who were provided a prescription for oral LDN. The study reports that a significant number of patients found combination therapy of an immunomodulating agent and LDN to be tolerable and possibly beneficial. Some patients preferred to take LDN as a monotherapy. The LDN did not cause any unexpected side effects, and those reported were previously noted in the literature. The LDN did not potentiate the side effects of the immunomodulating therapies that the patients were receiving. Any hospitalizations in this study were related to reasons other than MS, and there were no hospitalizations due to LDN.”\\nAUTHOR DISCLOSURE\\nAnthony P.

She told me I could schedule it with Temple Neurology but they have no idea what that test is.\\nDallas is two hours away from me and I would have to get someone to drive me because I can't make it from the parking lot to the clinic so I am trying to figure out if it is worth the hassell?\\nI don't care about getting 25ft 2 seconds faster but I would like to go 400ft.\", 'Dear stacey,\\nI took Ampyra for a few years, and it did improve my walking - speed, coordination, and distance. Now I take a compounded version of the active ingredient, 4-ampyradine. It doesn\\'t work quite so well, but my MS has advanced also. I got patient assistance from Acorda, the maker of Ampyra, but it has been discontinued. My medicare Plan D has a very high copay even for the new generic versions. That is why I resorted to a compounded medicine.\\nThe 25-foot walk test is something my neuro does every visit. The speed is recorded. But I don\\'t think that means that my treatments are solely limited to things that might improve such a short distance walk. The 25-foot test is a requirement for Ampyra, I understand, because that medicine doesn\\'t work for everyone and even a little walk can reveal whether walking in general is getting any better. One third of MS patients get no result, one third get some benefit, and one third have a great improvement. I think I am in the top of the middle.\\nMy walking is more fluid, and all my movements are easier and faster with the medicine. Falls are rare. Nevertheless, without taking frequent rests, I can only walk (with my walker) a block or two on a \"good\" day. I use my cane in interiors (church, restaurants, social gatherings). At home, I can coast along without any aide. If I forget to take the medicine, however, I notice all of my movements are much much worse. So I feel that it is useful.\\nI hope you get enough information from a neurologist about your particular MS to assess the benefit to you.

This particular patient prompted me to write a few blog posts to try and explain what is happening to her brain…\\nAn important question in relation to this patient is why do some DMTs have such a profound impact on end-organ damage markers, in particular, brain volume loss and others do not? Not all DMTs are made equal when it comes to preventing, or slowing down, brain volume loss.\\nAt the top of the league table are alemtuzumab and HSCT (~0.2-0.25% loss per annum). Both these treatments are NIRTs (non-selective immune reconstitution therapies). Natalizumab is next with an annual brain volume loss in region of 0.25-0.3% per annum. Ocrelizumab comes fourth with a rate of brain volume loss of ~0.35% per annum. Fingolimod 5th at 0.4% per annum. Cladribine 6th at ~0.55% per annum and then the other runs after that.” End Quote\\nThe study below shows disability correlates with brain atrophy.\\nTreatment Effect on Brain Atrophy Correlates with Treatment Effect on Disability in Multiple Sclerosis\\nurl\\nhttps://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/aa7...544a52a997.pdf', 'Originally posted by lindaincolorado View Post\\nI went on Copaxone for 2 1/2 years, my sx and lesions progressed .

IMO, you life would be changed dramatically, and for the worse, had you followed their extremely unwise advice.\\nIMO, you are definitely on the right path by continuing with Tysabri. I will make a prediction... in a few years the advice to go off a highly successful DMT because \"with age MS slows down\" will be viewed as HARMFUL to a patient\\'s health.

I plan to talk to him about ALA. And natalizumab. But first I will probably need to eat some humble pie.\", \"Why did Giavononni wait?\\nOriginally posted by Myoak View Post\\n“What this patient doesn’t know, despite no new visible T2 lesions, is that she has developed obvious, to the naked eye, progressive brain atrophy.\\nExactly MyOak! I'm a huge fan of Giavonnoni et al, but why didn't he tell his patient years ago that her Gilenya wasn't controlling her brain volume loss?\\nWhen I got my first MRI in 2012, I thought it looked like there was atrophy. My neuro dismissed me. That's a big part of the reason I went to Denver.\", 'Hello Mable,\\nWhy did Giavononni wait to tell a patient that brain loss volume leads to disability?\\nI have no idea; I can only speculate. But I congratulate him for talking about it now. His website has a monthly Q & A section where that question can be asked.\\nBrain atrophy as a clinical endpoint in DMT trials has only been introduced in the last few years. Before recently not much attention was given brain loss volume. Unlikely that many neuros have discussed it with their patients, unfortunately.\\nHowever, going forward I believe brain atrophy will be discussed in the context of which DMT to choose; it is just now beginning to be recognized as a vitally important factor relative to disability.\\nGilenya is better at reducing brain loss volume (BLV) than most DMTs although I personally would not choose Gilenya if I had MS. But the particular patient mentioned was NEDA on it, Mable, so for her it was/is effective.\\nAll the other DMTs for MS are worse than Gilenya in reducing BLV except those Giavononni listed … HSCT and Lemtrada 0.2-0.25%, Tysabri 0.25-0.3%, Ocrevus 0.35%, Gilenya at 0.4%.\\nSo, what should this patient on Gilenya be taking instead of Gilenya? That is a tough question because she is NEDA on it and her response to the others cannot be precisely predicted. With DMTs there are patients who develop neutralizing antibodies which render a DMT useless or even counterproductive.\\nHSCT is not widely available even though, IMO it is clearly the most successful DMT. Next on my list is Tysabri; not Lemtrada even though some do very, very well on Lemtrada. With Lemtrada most people (but not all) will battle significant secondary immunity problems. That is why Lemtrada gives me pause.\\nWith those thoughts in mind, Tysabri would be my choice whether I was JCV positive, or negative. Before going on dose extension with Tysabri (btw, convincing the neuro literally nearly took fist-fighting; our arguments were that intense, he finally caved, learned, or something and agreed that dose extension de-risks for PML. The lesson here is that sometimes you actually have to fight or change doctors for what you are convinced of, as Linda explained in her post) and before switching to Ocrevus my spouse had received more infusions of Tysabri than anyone in the world according to her neurologist. Ocrevus is a very, very good DMT but not quite as effective as Tysabri in reducing fatigue and BLV.\\nThe PML aspect often scares patients away from Tysabri when MS progression should be leading MSers toward Tysabri, IMO.\\nIMO, HSCT is the best option. But if HSCT is not available, Tysabri is the next best, IMO.\\nPlease keep in mind not every DMT works well for every patient.\\nMy opinion is based on experience in my household and results found in DMT trial and real-world data.\\nIsn’t it fun choosing a DMT? It would challenge Solomon. Choices can be narrowed down by prioritizing what is most important to an individual but it still can seem like a crap shoot.\\nGood luck and certainly, you have my best wishes!\\nOh, one last point… we all lose brain volume as we age. In one scientific study the BLV per year was “0.20% at the age of 35 years increasing to 0.52% at 70 years” in healthy subjects. Often, BLV in MS is listed at 0.7% and higher. So, the best DMTs get that rate at very near normal. Recall even Gilenya was at 0.4%.\\nIn the near future, BLV will be used as a marker for how well a DMT is doing for a particular patient, I’m certain.', 'Originally posted by Mamabug View Post\\nI\\'m scared to go off Copaxone.

You don't know that you wouldn't have had new lesions even on the med you were taking the same way I will never know if the drug I took prevented new lesions or not. The statistics speak to the group and never to an individual. We use the stats to go with the odds.

I sat on an PML advisory board several years ago and we reviewed all the PML cases linked to rituximab; we didn\\'t find a single case on monotherapy. The one case referred to here on minimal immunosuppressive therapy had been on steroids. The take home message is that the risk of PML on rituximab is very low; the caveat being carryover PML from natalizumab. I think rituximab, and by inference ocrelizumab and other anti-CD20 therapies, will be a relatively safe drugs to transition onto from natalizumab.\"\\nhttp://multiple-sclerosis-research.b...l#comment-form', 'This is a very, very interesting thread, especially for pwMS in the USA.\\nIf your neuro is considering Rituxan rather than Ocrevus he/she is absolutely brilliant, IMHO.\\nWhy?\\nBecause Ocrevus and Rituxan are very, very similar. Both are good meds for MS. Ocrevus was developed because the patent ran out on Rituxan. Ocrevus is tweaked Rituxan. Tweaked, primarily to get a new patent and charge at least 10x what Rituxan costs.\\nSince they are quite similar why do I think Rituxan is better?\\nBecause the dose and the frequency of infusions can be individually tailored. The neuro does not have to give you a set dosage nor does he have to give it to you every six months as with Ocrevus. That fact might save your life if the spike in cancer rates seen during Ocrevus trials turns out to be an actual risk in real world use of Ocrevus. We don’t know, yet. However, we do know that Ocrevus keeps working at least 18 months after the last infusions during trials.\\nHere is a link proving that statement...\\nhttps://www.ebiomedicine.com/article...17)30045-2/pdf\\nClick the link and look at the chart on page 6. It shows that Ocrevus continued providing protection 18 months after no more infusions were received.\\nClearly, Ocrevus every six months could be too much for some people. Especially if the cancer risk plays out. The cells being depleted by Ocrevus are needed to fight off cancer. So, if you over-deplete them, you may put yourself at an increased risk of cancer. Please understand Ocrevus is new so we have to wait to know for sure if there will be an increase of cancer seen using Ocrevus.\\nTo me, it makes sense that it would, although it may take years to prove.\\nSo, what would an excellent clinician do? I think he would give Rituxan only as often as his patient required. That means if there are no new or enhancing lesions or no new significant clinical signs of MS progression then you may not need an infusion every six months. And, if you get infusions you don’t need why put yourself at risk of cancer or any other health issue which may arise from getting more of an immune suppressing medicine than you need to control MS?\\nIMO, any doctor using Rituxan rather than Ocrevus is on top of all of this and far out in front of it. I envy anyone who has such a doctor.\\nMost neuros are going to infuse a person with MS with 600mg of Ocrevus every six months, period, end of discussion. That’s what the FDA approved and, by God (my sincere apologies, no offense is intended) 600mg every six months is what you are going to get even if it kills you; and for some it may… if an increased cancer risk is demonstrated infusing Ocrevus every six months.\\nYes, I believe Rituxan is a better option than Ocrevus because I believe a neuro can more easily adjust the dosage and frequency with Rituxan. If you achieve NEDA (No Evidence of Disease Activity) with Rituxan your neuro is free NOT to infuse you until and unless you need it.\\nIts just as likely to achieve NEDA with Ocrevus but the difference is you are going to keep getting it every six months.\\nWith Ocrevus a person with MS will get 600mg every six months no matter if you weigh 90 lbs. or 300 lbs. and regardless of the individual variance in B-cell depletion even though that depletion may be adversely affecting health issues outside of MS.\\nIMHO, it will be YEARS before this situation is recognized and adjustments made to accommodate it, if ever. Change happens slowly.\\nI pounded the table in heated discussion with my spouse’s neuro for an entire year before he finally agreed to extend time between doses of Tysabri to reduce PML risk. Based on that experience, I can predict it will be pure hell for any patient trying to alter the dose or frequency of Ocrevus. It is usually futile and can be extremely stressful arguing with a neurologist even when it is your life that is at stake.\\nIMHO, what makes Rituxan a FAR superior medicine to Ocrevus is that the dose and frequency of infusions can be adjusted individually as required.\\nIf your neurologist is using Rituxan rather than Ocrevus you have an excellent neurologist, IMO.\\nBTW, one person said their insurance did not approve Rituxan. Wow, insurance ought to compare the cost of those two meds if they want to save a ton of money. Rituxan is far less expensive.', \"I do rituximab and prefer it to Tysabri and ocrelizumab.\\nI am jcv+ so I don't see Tysabri as a long term medication for me.

She reported zero cases of PML and since then have been no reports of a single case of PML in those who are JCV+ and going 5, 6, 7, or 8 weeks between infusions.\\nI am going to keep shouting that out until every person on Tysabri knows it.

But even if you do, you can go on dose extension and greatly decrease your risk of developing PML, and if the trend of no cases holds... well, even better.\\nLastly, people on Tysabri convert from negative to positive about 10 times faster than the general population according to one study. Therefore, it is logical to believe if you were less saturated with Tysabri, as you would be on dose extension, it is probable that people on Tysabri would convert from negative to positive less frequently. Yes, IMO, you would be less likely to convert to positive. That is only my opinion.\\nAs time goes on data will be mined to find if that is the case, if you want to wait 10 years on it is another matter.\\nGo with what makes sense to you.

A 6-week schedule in those who are JCV- will delay or prevent conversion, I firmly believe.

You will have to be firm, willing to argue, willing to make your doctor mad… all fun, right? Seriously, I am so, so sorry if that is the sad situation anyone has to face. But I’d rather prepare you for battle than pretend you won’t have one.\\nBiogen makes money from infusions so Biogen is not going to go along with extending dose in those JCV-. That is the reality… you are fighting Biogen’s push-back. Nothing else can explain why any thinking neuro would not immediately agree to 6-week infusions for even his JCV negative patients, IMO.\\nSarabeach, good luck, girl! I know you can and will get this done. If he does not agree to 6-week infusions keep hammering every appointment. YOU ARE RIGHT! That gives you great strength. He would put you on 6-weeks in a heartbeat if you were JCV+ and at the rate of conversion you will get there someday, anyway. He will give in if you keep trying. Its your life.

And btw, your post to the 21-year-old girl was one of the best I’ve ever read. Well done!\\nHello Medina69,\\nYou live in Sweden? I should have said that if you are in the US you are going to get 600mg of Ocrevus every 6 months. Doctors here are extremely reluctant to do anything outside established protocols because they get sued so often. It may be altogether different there. My guess is that your doctors may have more wiggle room and they could adjust dose as needed. I bet so. Sweden was where the dose extension theory originated for Tysabri. Someone mining your national health data noticed lighter weight people got PML more than heavier people. And the theory that Tysabri concentration was less in heavier people to explain it. Turned out to be true… decrease the concentration and MS is still in check and PML is de-risked. Thank you, Sweden,!!!!!!!!\\nHello murrayms,\\nWow, they really loaded you with rituximab! They must have wanted to really get on top of the situation with MS and I bet it worked, too. If infected B-cells are driving MS and they wiped them out, I bet that largely halted your MS progression. You mentioned your CD19 was near zero. Likely, your CD20 was very low, also. Both of those are types of b-cells.\\nYou were on Rituxan then they switched you to Ocrevus. You will do well on it, also. They both have almost the identical effect in depleting those types of cells.\\nOff label, and that is how rituximab is being used in MS, it seems as though neuros are more willing or more free to adjust dose and number of infusions.\\nWhy your neuro switched can only be guessed but it could be a liability issue, I suppose, or money. Ocrevus is approved for MS; rituximab is not.\\nBack to your point about b-cell depletion… what need is there to get an infusion of a b-cell depleter, either Ocrevus or rituximab, if you are already at zero or very, very low? That is exactly what I mean by adjusting the dose and frequency of infusions. Why get more than you need and potentially put yourself at a safety risk? Some people may need a lot to zero out those b-cells but some surely do not. Why suppress your immune system more than necessary if MS is subdued? Remember Tysabri and how dangerous it was to do that.\\nThe best doctors, IMO, will test for depleted b-cells and make adjustments in dose and frequency but I’m afraid most won’t. Too busy seeing patients, I suppose.\\nWe see how many years it took with Tysabri for doctors to stubbornly, finally recognize that too much Tysabri was killing patients and make adjustments in dose and frequency.\\nOne has to wonder if something similar may happen with Ocrevus if the cancer risk plays out. There may be no increased cancer risk with Ocrevus; we have to wait on data! Importantly, Ocrevus has little PML concern so the situation is not nearly the same as with Tysabri.\\nOcrevus and rituximab is selective about the b-cells they deplete. We want b-cells for proper immune function... we want depletion to the point of controlling MS but not destroying decent immune function... that is wonderful balance we hope to achieve.\\nTysabri seems to have gotten there in achieving that balance.\\nOf course, Tysabri does not wipe out b-cells; it only prevents them from crossing the blood-brain barrier.\\nOcrevus is still too new to achieve such nuance in dose or frequency. That is why, IMO, rituximab is a good option… off-label, in the USA anyway, I think it is easier to adjust than it will be with Ocrevus, Sure, Ocrevus can be adjusted but will they? Likely not. I believe doctors will be as pig-headed with it as they were with Tysabri for years.\\nHopefully, doctors are different in Sweden… or perhaps it would be better to say they have more freedom from lawsuits and can practice more freely to accommodate individual patient’s needs.\\nBest wishes!', 'Yes i am from Sweden,i did not know that about Tysabri..great news\\nI know roche has been in conflict with the neurologists here,but the doctors \"won\" so to speak,so they keep using rituxan.i got my first dose in april.1000 mg. in october i will get 500 mg', 'I know roche has been in conflict with the neurologists here,but the doctors \"won\" so to speak,so they keep using rituxan.i got my first dose in april.1000 mg. in october i will get 500 mg\\nThat is great news!

I really need to restrain myself when I see recommendations of Copaxone, Rebif, even Tecfidera, hence \"hair on fire\". I was so lucky to have a progressive neurologist in little old Montana back in 2010 who got me on Tysabri as my first medication. I watched her get other 20 somethings on the medication, and their MS just seemed to disappear.

What I see in this household switching from Tysabri to Ocrevus is more fatigue and more MS symptoms. Of course, response varies individually, as always.

People contemplating going on a DMT need to know what your experience is with Tysabri and what you have observed in others.\\nWith expanding acceptance of dose extension as a method to de-risk for PML in those JCV+ using Tysabri I hope Tysabri will be more thoroughly considered by those choosing a DMT.\\nI agree with you that choices like Copaxone, Rebif, Tecfidera and most others commonly offered the newly diagnosed are going to be hugely disappointing in the long run if irreversible damage occurs while taking those meds rather than a highly effective one like Tysabri.\\nI agree with you... attack MS early and aggressively. The wait and see what happens is last century's bad idea in neurology. We did that and it was a bad idea.

Sorry for double posting.\\nHello,\\nI am new to this forum. I am 28 years old, female, my MS was diagnosed 9 years ago. My first relapse was numbness/sensatory problems in both legs, it recovered. The first five years I had rebif and avonex and in that period I had one relapse with balance problems, I fully recovered.\\nIn the past 4 years I took tecfidera. First two years there were no relapses and no new MRI activity. After a heavy coughing infection I got one light relapse in 2017 with one new 3mm lesione.\\nBut this year I suddenly had two relapses, stiffness in my leg and a few weeks later in my hand. It was quite scary because I was almost unable to use the hand for around two weeks. Both fully recovered with prednisolone influsions.\\nNow the doctors say I should go on Tysabri as my JCV is negative. But the weird thing is, my new MRIs both spinal and brain do not show any new lesions and no activitiy. The brain MRI shows no new lesions since last year. In the year before I had that one 3mm lesione that I mentioned above.\\nIn the spine, they didn\\'t even see anything new since 2009! I dont really get it as my relapses were relatively strong at least from what I had experienced before.\\nI also have to say that this year I had the most stressful period of my life because I am in the finishing period of my PhD. But this will be over in a few weeks.\\nDo you think I should start Tysabri now or have another MRI in a few months and see if I stabilize once the stress is over?\\nI am JCV negative, so the PML would not be an issue. However, due to my job I was always spending longer periods abroad working in different institutes (sometimes three months, sometimes a year). With Tecfidera I could always take it with me but Tysabri I have to get here, I guess (Germany). I know it is available in many countries, but I think my insurance wouldn\\'t cover it abroad.\\nOf course, health is more important, and I am willing to change my lifestyle eben though I loved longer stays abroad. But as I understood, shorter travels up to 4 weeks will still be possible, right?\\nI am now feeling completely free of symptoms, I excercise, take Vit D and my tecfidera. But of course, the relapses earlier this year worried me. On the other hand, the MRI was quiet and the very specific dissertation-related stress will be over soon.\\nI find that such a difficult decision to make. I am worried about the rebound. Once I stop Tysabri I will have to go on a (probably stronger) medication immediately as far as I understood.\\nMe and my partner also want to have children in the coming years. My neuro said Tydabri would not be a bad option then since there is a lot of experience on tysabri patients + pregnancy.\\nDifficult decision Maybe someone can give me some ideas about what you think.\\nThank you!', 'They say, if once you will start taking the Tysabri, take it as long as possiblle. Cause once you will stop, you will notice deterioration. This was also my case. It was happened maybe because of at that time I switched from RRMS to SPMS. After I had canceled with Tysabri I went to steroids and Gylenia, but I did not improve my condition anymore.\\nAlso canceling Tysabri is linked with other risks.\\nI think you should talk with your neuro about your plans and future and take his/her advice.', \"Hello StickyRice!\\nI have been meaning to write but have been terribly busy; I have been thinking about you much, though.\\nFirst, your doctors are concerned about the increased MS activity. Yes, stress can be a contributor but their concern goes beyond stress and they want to get a handle on MS progression.\\nOne of your concerns is receiving infusions out of country. Possibly you could work with your supplier and they may be able to ship it to an infusion center out of country. As long as it is kept cool in a well insulated container, shipped, and arrived still cool, there would be no problem. Also, as others have pointed out, extending dose past 4 weeks is prudent for many. My wife got infusions every 8 weeks and was just fine. But I have no idea what leeway doctors have in Germany where you live.\\nMany times when someone is JCV- they remain on a 4-week infusion schedule. However, I think that is foolish for those who are doing well enough to extend time between doses. Why? For an exceedingly important reason... it is well established that people on Tysabri convert from negative to positive faster than the general population. So, the fact that some people who are JCV neg extend time between doses may keep them from turning positive and they can live w/o fear of PML. No JCV = no PML.\\nWhy Tysabri? I can honestly say that the years my spouse was on Tysabri were years when no one could even tell she had MS. Last year she switched to Ocrevus and now has more fatigue. Her energy level has changed, she sleeps more and gets tired more easily.\\nYou are young and just beginning a career. You need energy to work. Tysabri, of ALL the MS DMTs provides the best opportunity for having the highest level of energy. You should be able to find that info on your own but I can follow that up, if you wish. Bart's MS Blog is a great source of MS info, btw.\\nAlso, you can find a study on Tysabri and pregnancies posted in the Tysabri thread.\\nIMO, the best chance you have for the most normal life possible is with Tysabri. My wife was on it from 2002 until 2017; it was taken off the market for one year when PML was discovered. Many people at this site have been on Tysabri a long, long time and done exceedingly well. Not everyone has success with it but many do. I agree with ru2cats, it is the best MS medicine available right now. JMHO.\\nBest Wishes!!!! You will do well!\", 'hi stickyrice,\\nI also stand by the previous two responses advice.\\nI have been on Ty for 7yrs now and am jc+ since day one.\\nIf you intend to have children you would like to be able to do as much as possible with them and Tysabri and Ocrevus have the best efficacy in regards to progression and disability.\\nIt is generally considered that tysabri has less side effects however.\\nthings can usually be arranged in regard to treatments overseas if necessary.\\nIt is your choice what treatment you choose.\\nOnce you have chosen the one that will achieve what you hope it will , then find out how to fit it in with your schedule.\\nbest of luck,\\nCaroline.', \"Hello StickyRice,\\nThe following 3 titles involving Tysabri from the 2018 ECTRIMS beginning Oct 10 in Berlin may be relevant to your question about starting Tysabri or waiting.

RRMS patients underwent 3.0T 3D high resolution brain MRI (Signa, GE) examination and comprehensive computerized cognitive assessment before initiation of Natalizumab and at 2 years of treatment, along with neurological assessments once every 3 months. FreeSurfer 5.3 was applied to obtain brain morphometrics and to perform paired, longitudinal, cortical thickness analyses.\\nResults: Sixty RRMS patients, 44 Females, 16 Males, age 36.3 ± 9.3 years, disease duration 8.4 ± 6.0 years, expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score 2.6 ± 1.5, were included. Following 2 years of Natalizumab treatment… Patients who started Natalizumab treatment early (≤7.5 years from onset) exhibited no cortical gray matter atrophy (CGMA) while those who initiated the treatment late (>7.5 years from onset) exhibited significant CGMA in five focal clusters on the right hemisphere and in one cluster in the left hemisphere, p< 0.02.

Muscle relaxers can help spasticity but they can come with some side effects that can affect your Quality Of Life (QOL).\\nMy suggestion is to be very aware of a worsening of your fatigue and to let your Neurologist know.

I try to just do the bare minimum errand wise and try not to over do it but its hard. My doctor gave me a script for Adderall but I was uncomfortable with taking that on a daily basis. I already don't sleep well due to the bladder issues being worse at night time. I found on another blog a med called Advanced Ambrotose made by Mannatech. Got it off Amazon recently, and just started it today. Worst cade it does nothing but if I could even just have a little more energy that would be great.\\nMy question is, has anyone tried this med before? What was your experience with it?

It's possible to take a small dose a few times a day and it won't keep you awake at night. All of the medications prescribed for MS fatigue does come with side effects, some serious. In my opinion it would be better to try treatments that is prescribed by your Dr. than spending a small fortune on something a Multi-level marketing company puts out.\\nDealing with MS fatigue is not easy. Sometimes the medications help, sometimes they don't and some are unable to use them. Non-medication options are rest/sleep, and exercise. There is a supplement that some have tried, unfortunately I don't remember the name, maybe someone else will.\", 'I would make sure your neuro knows of any supplement you take. In some cases, they can have risks, or interact with prescriptions, so the worse case is more than just not alleviating symptoms.\\nI was on amantadine and provigil, which the latter worked for years.

But when it flares up or when a new lesion is discovered it pretty much forces a choice of one DMT or another, no matter how difficult the choice.\\nYou said you have been on 4 MS meds and your neuro wants you to consider 3 more and pick one. The problem I see is that the 3 he gave you to pick from are no more effective in slowing disease activity than the first 4.\\nTwo notables DMTs not on your list to pick from are Tysabri and Ocrevus. Notable because both are significantly more effective than any of the others mentioned in your post.\\nAll MS meds have a unique set of risks but, perhaps, the biggest risk the less effective DMTs carry is the risk of treating MS with a med not effective enough to make a significant difference in decreasing disease activity.\\nIf HSCT is not an option then Tysabri or Ocrevus are options to consider if the 4 lesser meds have not worked... and... if your MS is aggressive enough to believe the 3 other meds with similar effectiveness to the first 4 may not slow disease progression enough for you, either.\\nI guess the question to ask is... if the first 4 meds were not effective, what is the basis for believing other meds of similar effectiveness would work? Is it time to consider something highly effective?\\nIf so, HSCT, Tysabri, and Ocrevus are all substantially more effective compared to the DMTs mentioned in your post... Copaxone, Avonex, Tecfidera, Plegridy, Aubagio, Betaseron, or Rebif.\\nYou have my empathy because treatment decisions are murderously difficult!

My current one is fairly mild as far as attacks go but what if the next one is not? What if the next one renders me unable to move a leg? Or a foot? or an arm? Or my vision? The science is pretty strong that the most of the DMTs, especially the current generation (the oral ones) do really well at preventing further progression.\\nThe science backs the fact that at this stage, they are the most effective. They can't make things better but they can make it from getting worse. With me having very little progression at this point, it makes sense to stop it here rather than waiting until I am half immobilized to do so.\\nWill they 100% for sure? No, but the odds are good in preventing further disability progression. For me that is absolutely worth it. My doc recommended the orals and I chose Gilenya and have done really well on it so far.

Sleep is essential; the time our bodies restore itself.\\nMy MS Neurourologist recommended I make lifestyle changes such as not reading on my iPad to fall asleep, and leaving it in the family room so I wouldn’t be tempted to gab it after those bathroom trips at 2am. She recommended shuti.com. I was shocked at how well implementing a few changes made big improvements to my sleeping. I often wake up at 5:30am and once I was stunned that the clock read 6:57am!!! I push my bed time to later than I thought I was capable of, I was always looking to go lay down 8-8:30pm.

And as we've recently found out, a high percentage of over the counter supplements do not even have a trace of what's on the label, so you could be pounding all those pills for nothing.

Your such a \"BEASTIE\" tee-hee!\\nDiamond', 'I still see a lot of comments asking about \"feeling better\" on Biotin. Feeling better is not the primary goal of any of our disease modifying therapies. All of our medications, including Biotin, are designed to change the natural history of the disease (slow progression). So while Biotin may improve your hair, nails and give you an energy boost your daily symptoms may never change. The real Biotin benefit will hopefully happen over time where you\\'ll have less progression over months or years.\\nI would encourage everyone to talk to your neurologist about Biotin and start getting them familiar with the therapy. While you may consider Biotin to be completely innocuous, it\\'s always a good thing that your neurologist is aware of all medications you are taking. Remember the vast majority of Biotin safety data is based on a tiny dose and not a 300 mg mega-dose. Also consider that you are not taking the 1 pill serving, but multiplying it by 20-30 tablets so look at the other ingredients.\\nJules - A number of medications are available over the counter (OTC) is one strength and by prescription in another. Vitamin D and Ibuprofen are good examples of this and Biotin will most likely follow this pattern. I have found that Biotin is cheaper in the 5 mg (5,000 mcg) variant than the 10 mg (10,000 mcg) version, but you\\'ll be swallowing twice the number of pills. Based on the current cost of Biotin a one year supply will cost about the same as one week of most of our existing disease modifying drugs. It will be interesting to see how much anyone will be able to charge for a 100 mg pill, but we may soon find out.\\nJ-Bo - At minimum, the FDA should grant a Priority Review for Biotin, but it could easily qualify as a Breakthrough Therapy, Accelerated Approval or Fast Track. The progressive MS population has an unmet medical need for a serious medical condition. When you consider Biotin is already on the market the process should be even faster. Biotin won\\'t move quite as fast as the Ebola trial medications, but it should still move much faster than the normal process.\\nAs always, I wish you all well.', \"I want to post some info that I have discovered in the last few days. I have been taking biotin 10,000mcg once daily for about a week. The manufacturer is Solgar which I buy at the Vitamin Shoppe.

But I was looking for biotin as a treatment for MS. That was not listed as of 5/14.\\nI had a thought about the clinical trials being run using biotin to treat ON.

It worked great! I was just referred to an excellent acupuncturist and had my first session yesterday. I didn\\'t notice much improvement in the dizziness but while shopping later, I laid down my cane to look at some clothes and proceeded to walk around the store without it.

Since then I have been on the same amount of oral baclofen as well as the micrograms from the pump with no improvement and in fact worse. I had my first adjustment yesterday. I told the nurse practioner doing the adjustment about the spasticity. She said it was probably due to the typical reaction of MS to any kind of infection or in this case the surgery. My ability to bend my leg and walk as I did (limited as it was) is worse. I have tightness in my calf that I didn't have before. The only improvement is that I don't get the random spasms in the evening anymore. Has anyone with the pump had this experience?

People come from miles for him. I trust him when he says no one has ever been worse from the pump.

Meds I have ruled out in the past were typically due to side effects that I experienced recovery from and didn't want to lose ground risking sx relapse from DMD side effects. For instance I avoided DMDs with GI side effects after recovery from decades of incontinence sx.\\nI tried Tefederia and Aubagio but decided the oral meds weren't for me. I took an unintended DMD break when I changed MS docs. The new MS doc is at a teaching hospital that seems to have less of a focus on clinical work versus teaching.\\nI don't believe 0crevus was approved a year ago when my MS doc recommended Rituxan? Before the 2 oral meds, I was on Tysabri. I wasn't sure I would make it past first three months, the early months were brutal for fatigue. After my 3rd Tysabri infusion, following decades of insomnia and bowel incontinence, both resolved, which were life changing improvements.\\nDuring the year spent untreated my strength and gait have progressed quite a bit.

So any self injections are out.\\nI was on Gilenya for 5 years - until the side effects got to be too bad. Tried Aubagio, but that one was WAY worse than I was willing to endure.\\nI think that Ty would be a possible for me. Or Rituxan or 0crevus (and you are correct - it was only approved recently). I had followed Lemtrada posts for a while, but that stuff is scary .\\nI ranted to my daughter about this recently and she (knowing that she will be my caretaker if / when) agreed hat the chance of slowing brain atrophy was not worth the cost of living a horrid life.

I traveled to India for Rituxin infusions (and took a Genentech made Rituxin, sold only in the Indian market for $3500 - apparently Indians pay less than Americans for cancer treatment). 14 months later and Ocrevus is approved.

I am JCV+ preventing my neurologist from writing a Tysabri script (I have a Veterans Affairs primary neurologist and he sends me to see two MS specialists once/year).\\nUnlike DMTs that are indicated for MS, Rituximab does not have just one treatment protocol. I believe the most common dose is two infusions, two weeks apart as a loading treatment. Then one infusion every six months into perpetuity. There are some doctors that use blood tests to determine when the next infusion occurs. My doctor wanted two infusions, two weeks apart twice per year.\\nNow, I have been reduced to one infusion every six months. It was weird not doing injections or taking daily pills, but I love needing treatment only every six months.\\nI have not had an infusion reactions, but I do premedicate and stay super-hydrated around infusion times.

I desparately need his help in two non-related areas so keeping him happy is important right now.\\nThe Rituximab patient that just contracted PML, after years of Tysabri use, was the final straw.

You might want to? Why would you want to?\\nYour post didn\\'t contain one shred of an indication or evidence that your doctor \"made a mistake\" in diagnosing you with SPMS. The only possible mistake I can see is the invention of unsavory innuendo against a doctor for the sole purpose of finding a scapegoat to blame for your insurance company denying your medication request. What an awful thing to do to someone. What an awful thing to suggest that someone do to someone.\\nIs there any reason you might think your doctor made \"a mistake\" in diagnosing you with SPMS?\\nAnd who would you ask about this alleged \"mistake\"? Your neurologist? What could your doctor possible say in response to that other than some version of, \"A copy of your medical records will be ready for you tomorrow so you can find another neurologist you trust more than me.\"\\nHave you talked with your neurologist about your insurance company\\'s denial of Ocrevus? Have you talked about a plan for appeal or treatment with a different medication?\\nThe NMSS website (http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Wha...Progressive-MS) lists several medications as being \"approved by the FDA for use in relapsing forms [plural, emphasis mine] of MS, which include those individuals who have transitioned to secondary-progressive MS but continue to have relapses and/or evidence of disease activity on MRI.\"\\nTheir The MS Disease-Modifying Medications brochure (http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Nat...edications.pdf) uses the term \"relapsing forms of MS in the FDA Approval column of their medication table. And not only the NMSS brochure, but also the Ocrevus prescribing information -- the ultimate source for a medication\\'s FDA approval information -- describes Ocrevus as being approved for \"relapsing or primary progressive forms of MS\" -- NOT specifically relapsing-remitting only. SPMS with relapses is still relapsing MS.\\nHave you had a relapse in, say, the last two years that can qualify your SPMS as relapsing? Perhaps the NMSS and/or Genentech might be able to provide approval information that might help you in an appeal with your insurance company.\\nAnd perhaps a more realistic question to ask your neurologist is whether s/he would consider changing your diagnosis back to RRMS?\\nThe NMSS medications brochure can provide information to help you and your neurologist look into other medication possibilities. They include mitoxantrone, an older drug that has gone generic (meaning less expensive for your insurance company) that was approved for secondary progressive.\\nMy insurance company (an HMO) approved Rituxan off-label for me for RRMS with no questions asked. I had 4 doses (the usual 2 doses 2 weeks apart, repeated 6 months later). Rituxan didn\\'t help me. Sort of the reverse. Both times I relapsed about 4 weeks after the second dose, which meant I was flaring more frequently on Rituxan than before I started it. So of course I didn\\'t continue.\\nI hope you can find a treatment med for relapsing forms of MS that works for you, maybe even Ocrevus on appeal. Good luck!', \"Rituxin/Ocrevus denial\\nHi JReagan 70. Thanks for you well thought out reply! Many of the points you make are great food for thought. No, I am pretty sure that I am SPMS. I have had MS for 26 years and remitted for most of them and about 4 years ago I stopped remitting. Now, when something happens, I know I am stuck with it.\\nI have tried ever class of drugs for MS (even been a test subject for Avonex's initial trial) except Aubagio because one of the side effects is vision problems. As I have already lost one eye to Optic Neuritis 20 years ago, I don't feel that is a risk I want to take. No, I don't think my doctor thought a rejection was coming because the time my insurance rejected Rituxin, they said it was because it was not FDA approved for MS. The FDA approved this version of a monoclonal antibody, so easy-peasy, right?\\nNevertheless, my neurologist has removed all of the SPMS language to the recent appeal letter.

Will everyone who has primary progressive MS benefit from Ocrevus?\\nA. We don’t know, since like all clinical trials, the Ocrevus trial in primary progressive MS limited the characteristics of people who could participate. The trial only included people who were aged 18 to 55, who had an EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale – a scale to assess neurological functioning used in clinical trials) score of up to 6.5 (meaning they were able to walk with the help of a walker or bilateral crutches or other devices on both sides), and who had evidence of immune proteins in a test of their spinal fluid (“oligoclonal bands”). It is not possible to predict how a specific individual will respond to treatment. The use of Ocrevus in clinical practice will help determine who is likely to benefit.\\nQ. Is it better to take it earlier than later for treating progressive MS?\\nA. In the ORATORIO trial for primary progressive MS, the average time from diagnosis in participants was 3.3 years. It is not known how the medication will work in people who have had primary progressive MS for longer periods of time.\\nThat helped my curiosity a little.

We encourage other companies to follow suit, creating a drug pricing trend that keeps patients first.\\nFAQ About FDA Approval of Ocrelizumab – brand name Ocrevus™ – for Primary Progressive and Relapsing Forms of MS\\nQ. How is ocrelizumab taken?\\nA. Ocrevus is administered by intravenous (into a vein) infusion every 6 months. At the beginning of treatment there are two doses separated by 14 days. After that, there is a single infusion every 6 months.\\nQ. When will ocrelizumab be available by prescription?\\nA. According to Genentech, people may talk to their MS doctors now about taking Ocrevus. The company expects supplies of the therapy to be available in about two weeks (around the week of April 4, 2017). Accessing the medication also depends on issues related to an individual’s health insurance.\\nQ. What if I no longer live in my own home. Can I still get Ocrevus if I live at an assisted living facility or a nursing home?\\nA. Whether you live at home or in a facility should not affect your ability to be on Ocrevus. However, insurance coverage may impact access to the medication.\\nQ. What will Ocrevus cost?\\nA. The list price has been announced as $65,000 per year. However, the price of Ocrevus to an individual who has MS will depend on the provisions of his or her insurance coverage and the degree to which that individual will be eligible for programs designed to assist with out-of-pocket costs.\\nQ. What is the National MS Society’s response to the posted price of Ocrevus?\\nA. The approval of Ocrevus is an exciting milestone for people with primary progressive MS and an encouraging new option for people with relapsing forms of the disease. The National MS Society applauds Genentech for their leadership in setting the wholesale acquisition cost (or list price) of Ocrevus at $65,000 per year — nearly 20 percent below the current market average for an MS treatment.

However, long-term exposure data do not allow conclusive evaluation of the risk of malignancies as well as rare risks, such as PML. The RMS and PPMS patient population included in the controlled MS trials is a selected patient population, not entirely representative of the MS patient population target of the two claimed indications.\\nFor instance median age of PPMS enrolled patients was 46 years...\\nThere is no information regarding patients older than 55 years. The absence of safety data in patients ≥55 years of age requires a more cautious approach with regard to the observed imbalance in malignancies, including breast cancer, observed in OCR-treated patients relative to comparator (IFN or placebo), as it is well known that the risk of malignancies increases with age.” End Quote\\nI quote page 172 broken into paragraphs for readability …\\n3.5 Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects\\n“More than 1173 MS patients were exposed to the proposed dose 600 mg dose for more than 95 weeks with a total of 4485 patient years of exposure to ocrelizumab in the MS population. However, even if this is a large safety database rare adverse events or adverse events likely to occur later might not have been captured. In particular, available long term exposure data do not allow to conclusively evaluate both the risk of malignancies as well as PML.\\nMoreover, the exclusion of patients >55 years old, prevents the assessment of the safety profile of OCR in the elderly, in particular with respect to malignancies, the risk of which is known to increase with age.\\nPatients with a history of recurrent or chronic infections or immunodeficiency, and patients with a history of ischemic cerebrovascular disorders were excluded from the pivotal trials.\\nCardiovascular disease was not among exclusion criteria, but there was only one enrolled patient with a history of cardiovascular disease (SMQ cardiac failure). The safety of OCR in the presence of the above mentioned morbidities is thus not assessable at present.\\nOpportunistic infections, but not PML were seen in the RA population where ocrelizumab exposure corresponds to 7324 patients years albeit in dose levels ranging from 20 mg to 2000 mg. Opportunistic and serious infections was also seen in the SLE and LN population and 6% and 3%, respectively died in these population due to infections.\\nIt is uncertain if safety data from these patient populations can be extrapolated to the MS population as patients in the RA, SLE and LN population also received additional immunosuppressant treatment, had different comorbidities and the RA population was older than the MS population.\\nIt is thus unknown if prior or current immunosuppressant treatment in the MS population will increase the risk of infections. It is also unknown, had the safety database been as large as in RA, if cases of opportunistic infections would have occurred in the MS population.\\nUp to the 30 Jun 2016, there were in total 26 cases of malignancies reported in MS patients treated with ocrelizumab. There was an imbalance in the incidence of malignancies in the ocrelizumab groups compared to IFN and placebo with a cluster of breast cancers in the ocrelizumab groups.\\nThere were no cases of breast cancer in the IFN or placebo groups whereas there were 3 cases in the RMS ocrelizumab group and 4 cases in the PPMS ocrelizumab group...\\nIn randomised controlled trials only about 20% of randomized RA patients received more than 2 OCR doses and only 38 patients received up to 8 OCR doses in the open label part.\\nThe higher incidence of malignancies, with a cluster for breast cancer, observed in OCR-treated patients relative to comparator (IFN or placebo) is a cause of concern, particularly as age >55 years was an exclusion criteria.\\nAdditionally, long-term safety has not been investigated, and for this reason the applicant will perform post-approval studies to address this issue.”\\nQuoting page 176, “The safety profile of ocrelizumab shows an increased frequency of malignancies compared to control groups, which seem to be driven by a cluster of breast cancer. However, the incidence was not higher as compared to epidemiological data and available data do not allow to definitely establish - nor rule out - a clear causality to ocrelizumab treatment.” End Quotes.\\nOnly time and data can definitely establish if cancer is more of a risk with Ocrevus.

The testing included walking, eye chart test, blood, pee, and MRI for a baseline measurement.\\nWent with ocrelizumab b/c I had failed Copaxone and Gilenya. On Gilenya had gotten a new lesion on spinal chord. With Gilenya I had had no new lesions in 4 years but had 2 relapses per year.

Seems that Ocrevus is about the same as Tysabri for efficacy without the high risk of PML. Since I was already risking cancer with Gilenya, it seemed not too big of a leap to have a similar risk with Ocrevus. What attracted me as well was the chance of not having so many relapses.

And speaking by Ocrevus, there are countries where you can get the Brand drug from Roche at $5k per infusion, i.e. 10k/year. Why does it cost 65k in the US?\\nA few thoughts for you ...\\nThe biggest cost driver is drug manufacturers are allowed to set their own prices in the US. In most other countries, the government sets the price point and if the company doesn\\'t accept the price than the drug will not be approved. So the US generally has a larger medication selection, but at a substantially higher price point. The US also subsidizes R&D and also lower costs medications to most of the world. The US gives billions and billions of medication to other countries and that cost gets passed along to US consumers. Just because a medication has an astronomical list price that doesn\\'t mean insurance companies are paying that price. Private insurance companies negotiate lower drug prices than list. Unfortunately, Medicare is prohibited from negotiating lower price points directly with the manufacturer.\\nPatients also want to cap their medication expenses so drug companies generally offer co-pay assistance programs. So a drug that lists for $6k/month is reduced to $4k/month by a commercial insurance company. Then the drug company steps in and provides co-pay assistance to the patient who ends up paying $50/month or less. So the numbers start off extremely inflated, but the consumer rarely gets stuck paying anywhere near list price.\\nIn the US, manufacturers are also allowed to market directly to patients via magazine, television, radio and even direct mail advertising. Direct marketing is effective and will often have a patient telling the doctor they want \"drug X\" that they saw on TV. Doctors have been sued so frequently that many now practice defensive medicine and give in to patient demands. Doctors also may not prescribe cheaper, but as effective, medications if cost information is not readily available. In addition to manufacturers marketing medications directly to patients, lawyers frequently market class action lawsuits directly to patients as well.\\nGovernment inefficiency and bureaucracy also drives up the cost of healthcare. The FDA is often slow to approve both new medications and generic alternatives. Government and insurance red tape is another cost driver. Doctors hire small teams of people to deal exclusively with pre-authorization, special paperwork and coordination between insurance and specialty pharmacy. I do not know of any MS drugs that do not require pre-authorization from an insurance company.\\nThe FDA is slow to approve new medications and also generic drugs. Pharmacists cannot always move patients to lower priced generics without patient consent. The brand medications comprise only about 10% of filled prescriptions, but they account for over 70% of all medication costs. Medication costs are under 15% of our total healthcare expenses so Americans are getting fleeced by other areas as well.\\nDrug companies get patents for 20 years so they can recoup R&D costs and turn a profit. That keeps generics off the market to lower costs. In the US, R&D costs are astronomical where one Phase III tests costing over $100 million. According to Tufts University a drug costs about $800 million to bring to market in 2003. In 2014, the same medication would not cost $2.6 billion to bring to market. That\\'s a lot of money considering only about 1 in 5,000 experimental drugs make it to market. Investors would be less inclined to invest in Biotech if the potential margins were small.

I do not know of any MS drugs that do not require pre-authorization from an insurance company.\\nThe FDA is slow to approve new medications and also generic drugs. Pharmacists cannot always move patients to lower priced generics without patient consent. The brand medications comprise only about 10% of filled prescriptions, but they account for over 70% of all medication costs. Medication costs are under 15% of our total healthcare expenses so Americans are getting fleeced by other areas as well.\\nDrug companies get patents for 20 years so they can recoup R&D costs and turn a profit. That keeps generics off the market to lower costs. In the US, R&D costs are astronomical where one Phase III tests costing over $100 million. According to Tufts University a drug costs about $800 million to bring to market in 2003. In 2014, the same medication would not cost $2.6 billion to bring to market. That\\'s a lot of money considering only about 1 in 5,000 experimental drugs make it to market. Investors would be less inclined to invest in Biotech if the potential margins were small. An investor would take that same money and drop it into a McDonald\\'s where small profit is almost guaranteed.[/QUOTE]', \"Had my pump implanted Wed.

I stayed in the hospital 2 nights.\\nThe pump incision is about 4 inches long, on the right side of my abdomen just below my waist. It had stitches which were removed after a week or so. The spinal incision was closed with steri-strips. Neither hurt much.\\nThe big thing is having to lay flat on your back for 24 hours to prevent a post dural puncture headache. This is a really painful type of headache. If you get one and it doesn\\'t go away, you can have a procedure called a blood patch, which stops it. About 10cc\\'s of blood is drawn and injected into the spine.\\nThe pump area is kind of tender for a while. Once it gets healed in it\\'s not noticeable. I sleep on that side without a problem.\\nThey pump is originally set to a fairly low dosage, then it is adjusted upward or downward until you have your optimum dosage. It is adjusted with a little hand held computer device that communicates with the pump by holding it against your skin right over the pump.\\nIt has relieved the pain the spasticity was causing. I am on a very low dose because one leg is very weak, and baclofen makes it weaker. It\\'s a balancing act.\\nThe pump gets refilled with a big scary looking syringe that actually has a pretty small gauge needle. The area over my pump is numb so I don\\'t have any problems with it.\\nWhen you have an MRI, it affects the pump and it will have to be checked afterward to be sure it restarts.\\nI don\\'t know if I\\'ve covered what you want to know, so just ask if you have questions.

So we have a lot of evidence right now that\\'s really suggesting that for a majority of patients, if we can treat them early enough with the right one of these second-generation drugs to maximize safety, we really can potentially fundamentally change the course of the disease where they don\\'t have to anticipate disability in the future.

In comparing efficacy of all DMTs with safety, none of the agents in the ICER report were deemed “ideal.”\\nAnnualized Relapse Rates Among DMTs\\nThree of the 4 relatively new DMTs (alemtuzumab, natalizumab, and ocrelizumab but not daclizumab) showed a reduction in the annualized relapse rate (ARR) of approximately 70% compared with placebo.\\nThe next most effective agents were fingolimod, daclizumab, rituximab, and dimethyl fumarate, collectively producing a 47% to 54% reduction in ARR.\\nThe lowest efficacy (17% to 37% reduction in ARR) was reported in a group of traditional therapies including interferons, glatiramer acetate 20 mg, and teriflunomide.\\nSlowing Disease Progression\\nThe newly approved agents (including alemtuzumab, ocrelizumab, daclizumab, and natalizumab) showed the most benefits in slowing disability in RRMS compared with placebo (58%, 53%, 46%, and 44% reductions, respectively).\\nFour older DMTs — interferon β-1a 30 mcg, interferon β-1a 22 mcg, teriflunomide 7 mg, and glatiramer acetate 40 mg — did not demonstrate significant improvements in disease progression. All others had moderate benefits.\\nSafety\\nThe safest agents were interferons, glatiramer acetate, and teriflunomide. The least safe, due to the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in patients with positive testing results for the JC virus, were alemtuzumab and natalizumab. Several drugs, including teriflunomide, daclizumab, fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, ocrelizumab, and natalizumab in JC virus-negative patients, were deemed to have moderate safety compared to all other DMTs.\\nValue of Therapy Compared to Supportive Care\\nThe ICER group developed a simulation model to estimate the lifetime cost of a particular therapy, taking into account wholesale acquisition cost, dosing, administration, monitoring, and average discounts applied. The estimated lifetime drug cost was then used as a basis of comparison with the costs of supportive care that included inpatient and outpatient care from multiple relapses, disease progression, and ultimate mortality from RRMS. Using this model, the related health care costs over a patient's projected lifetime ranged from approximately $572,000 for alemtuzumab to $1.5 million for daclizumab, compared with approximately $333,300 for supportive care. The model took into account costs from relapses and prevented relapses in RRMS, as well as incremental costs-per-life-year gained and quality-adjusted life years.\\nUsing an acceptable threshold of $150,000 for cost per therapy, compared with supportive care alemtuzumab ($35,000) provided the highest number of quality-adjusted life years gained at a significantly reduced cost compared with all other therapies (range = $185,000 for interferon β-1b 250 mcg to $341,000 for interferon β- 1a 22 mcg).\\nOverall, the report suggests that the improved clinical benefits of newer agents must continue to be weighed against the risks of safety complications and financial burden over a patient's lifetime.\\nhttp://www.neurologyadvisor.com/mult...rticle/637539/\", \"Great info, Marco !

I believe Medigap insurance could be an issue.\\nMedicare defines a pre-existing condition as any health condition or disability that you have prior to the coverage start date for a new insurance plan. If you have Original Medicare or Medicare Advantage, you are generally covered for all Medicare benefits even if you have a pre-existing condition or disability. However, if you’re enrolled in a Medicare Supplement (Medigap) plan or have end-stage renal disease (ESRD), there are some exceptions', 'No Evidence of Progression More Likely Among PPMS Patients on Ocrevus\\nOcrevus (ocrelizumab) increased the proportion of patients with no evidence of progression (NEP) in the recently concluded ORATORIO Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS).\\nNEP was defined as having no disability progression as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) at 12 weeks, and no confirmed progression of 20 percent or more on the timed 25-foot walk test and on the 9-hole peg test. These tests cover the patient’s overall disability, including both arm function and ambulation. Patients continued evaluations until the end of the study or until researchers recorded a pre-specified number of progressions.\\nAt 120 weeks, 42.7 percent of Ocrevus-treated patients reached NEP, compared to only 29.1 percent among those receiving placebo. The difference represents a 47 percent relative increase in the Ocrevus group.\\nhttps://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/2017/02/23/actrims2017-no-evidence-of-progression-among-large-part-of-ppms-patients-on-ocrevus-reason-for-optimism/', \"Marco, thank you for the info; you are always great with details.

I can help with the math part. To find the percentage increase from 29.1 to 42.7, you first find the difference between the two (42.7 - 29.1, which equals 13.6), then you divide the difference by the original number, 29.1. So 13.6/29.1, which equals 46.89, which rounds up to 47%. So that's the percentage increase over 29.1.

Far from feeling better I became agitated and I started having racing thoughts. So I decided to take some seroquel which can serve as an antimanic agent. I also added in some latuda bc it gives me akathesia and I thought maybe the constant desire to move would at least give some form of energy/movement. Sure it will. Compulsive uncomfortable movement.\\nThe sad irony is that if my doctor had seen me maybe two days before he may have suspected some hypomania at the least, and may have decided not to prescribe the adderall. I told him everything up front. He agreed with the calming effects of seroquel but rightly said the prozac and latuda were not helpful which I assured him I had already stopped. He's known me for years and knows I'm more sensible than not (and probably knows I might do something stupid again) so he wrote me prescriptions and added seroquel and adderall.\\nIn hindsight it was not worth it.

I felt much stronger when I first got home, but after a few weeks I have been extreme weaker.\\nBefore the surgery, the anesthesiologist gave me some steroids and I\\'m wondering if maybe that helped me.\\nThe steroids you had before surgery might have made you feel \"stronger\" because one of the side effects of steroids is hyperactivity. I once wallpapered a bedroom all by myself after a Solu-Medrol 3-day. And my refrigerator had never been so clean.\\nYou might be feeling weaker now simply because of the inactivity that comes with having a broken leg. Even otherwise healthy people routinely need physical therapy to rebuild their strength after a having a broken leg. Remember, not everything is MS.\\nThe purpose of all of the immunosuppressant and immunomodulatory drugs is to keep people OFF steroids whenever possible. If you\\'re secondary progressive and still having inflammation, the better route is to be on one of the MS treatment meds and NOT try to replace them with steroids. If you\\'re on an MS treatment med and you think a different med might work better for you, that\\'s a great conversation to have with your neurologist.\\nThe only situation I can think of where periodic steroids might be taken instead of an MS med is a case of relapsing, inflammatory MS when none of the MS meds are effective or tolerable, or if the risks of all of the meds are greater than the risks of steroids for that person. That\\'s quite rare, and I know that because I\\'m one of those people.\\nYou really DON\\'T want to be taking periodic steroids.

The FDA doesn't choose what a drug is used for. The use is chosen by the patent holder/manufacturer in their new drug application.\\nThe use is chosen by the applicant. The applicant presents clinical data that, it is hoped, demonstrates that the drug is safe (which is a relative term) and effective for the use being applied for. The FDA then approves or rejects the drug for that specific use. The FDA has no influence over what use is chosen, or the use the drug is approved for, other than to agree that the drug is safe and effective for that use.\\nBecause drug trials cost multi-millions of dollars, drug companies limit the number of uses applied for in order to keep the cost of the trials down. If there is the potential of profit for other uses, the company will then run more clinical trials for the second purpose. It has to apply for the additional use(s) separately.\\nAn example of this is Ampyra, which is approved only to increase walking speed. There doesn't appear to be any potential for profit in testing and applying for another other use.\\nAnother example is Tysabri. After it was approved for MS, Biogen did separate trials and applied separately for its approval for treatment of Crohn's disease. Obviously there was the potential for profit in using it to treat another disease.\\nThe specific use(s) for a drug is part of the drug's labeling. The FDA doesn't forbid use of drugs off-label, but it forbids drug companies to advertise or in any way promote off-label uses.\\nOnce a drug loses patent protection and goes generic, there's no motivation for anyone to do clinical trials to get a new use approved. They can't get another patent for that use because it's the same drug, and there's no way to make back the money that would be spent on drug trials.\\nNor does the FDA have any influence over what drugs insurance companies put on their formularies or what uses of the drugs the insurers cover.\\nSo that's why the FDA can't be pressured to add an approved use to force an insurer to cover the cost of a drug.

Because the side effects can't clear up quickly, they might seem different.\\nOriginally posted by Ikaika View Post\\nDoctor and Pharmacist said the 200mg ER is a 24 hour release tablet. But the paperwork that come with the Rx say 12 hour. Anyone in the know?\\nYou would do better to rely on the scientific information in the prescribing information, which has been reviewed and approved by the FDA.\\nYour doctor and pharmacist are correct that the ER formula has the capability of releasing something over 24 hours. But that doesn't at all mean that the tablets release a perfectly metered amount of medication that is exactly the same over 24 hours and that the med only needs to be taken once every 24 hours. (I can see how your doctor may not understand this, but your pharmacist should know better.)\\nThe amount of medication varies over the 24 hours, and the level peaks in the blood somewhere between 3 and 12 hours (which could be why you're waking up swollen and puffy if you take it at bedtime). And that's why, in regular usage, the ER version is taken 2X a day instead of once -- because the peak level should be renewed every 12 hours, not every 24.

The normal, quicker-acting med may allow the edema to dissipate quickly so it doesn't accumulate and you don't swell up, but the trade-off may be that you'll have to take the med more often.

The majority of seizures happened within days to weeks after starting the recommended dose and occurred in patients having no history of seizures.\\nIn addition, FDA is updating the Ampyra drug label to clarify recommendations that kidney function should be checked in patients before starting Ampyra and monitored at least annually while Ampyra treatment continues.

My understanding is, it will be approved in Dec.2016. Where did you read about some deaths?\", \"Ocrelizumab was originally developed as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. During trials, a few patients developed infections and died. It was decided that RA patients weren't willing to risk death from a treatment drug, so the manufacturer abandoned it as a treatment for RA.\\nThe manufacturer recognized through the history of Tysabri that MS patients are willing to risk death from a drug. Coupled with the favorable results experienced by some patients with RRMS, the manufacturer quickly switched the target audience for ocrelizumab to people with MS. Fortunately, no patients with MS died during the clinical trial.\\nOne thing that's being overlooked about ocrelizumab is that its predecessor, Rituxan, was tested in PPMS and was, overall, no more effective than placebo. In PPMS, it was found that 1) younger patients with 2) inflammatory activity did slightly better as a subgroup.\\nThe only difference between ocrelizumab and rituxumab is the source of the antibody. Yet somehow, the results for ocrelizumab in PPMS were better. So it remains to be seen whether that was a statistical fluke, a result of deliberate subject choice, a direct result of using human cells as a source, or something else.\\nThis drug isn't that much different from the one that led to several deaths and was not effective in PPMS. In spite of how neat and tidy the clinical trial for PPMS was, I think we all should be prepared for the possibility that older PPMS patients who don't have active, inflammatory disease will get no benefit from ocrelizumab -- and that will be after they have several doses and gotten their hopes up unrealistically high.

Helps with my walking, leg cramps... Helps with BINO (I know no such thing). Helps with numbness. Eye pain. Stops lesions?\\nYou\\'re looking for A drug? One drug to make MS go away? There isn\\'t a magic bullet for MS. If there were, everyone with MS would be skipping and twirling down flowery lanes without a care in the world.\\nThere are multiple drugs available to manage -- not cure -- individual issues, including disease treatment and symptom management. And there\\'s a lot of information about them to learn that no one can spoon feed to you. The only way to learn is to do the work of studying and learning about them by yourself.\\nSo I second the previous poster\\'s advice to go to the website of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and study up on the available medications. But even more... Read over ALL of the educational material on the website, then read it again and again until you think you have a good feel for it. There are no shortcuts for learning about and living with MS.\\nOriginally posted by vender View Post\\nI know that the info is on the web I just can\\'t read for long periods and what better place for info than you folks...\\nTo the contrary. When you read a forum, you\\'re reading the web just the same as you\\'re reading any other website -- 5 minutes of reading is 5 minutes of reading, no matter where it is. So if duration of reading is a challenge, you can cover one eye to get rid of the double vision, turn up the magnification and read slowly. I know that\\'s not what you wanted to hear, but that\\'s the reality of it.\\nFrom my years of reading MS forums, it\\'s obvious that at least 75% of people have no grasp of the facts of MS, even after having MS for decades, and disseminate misinformation that can be harmful to a newbie like yourself. So there are MANY better places to get factual information about MS than a forum. Forums are great places to talk about experiences, feelings, opinions and recommendations, but they\\'re terrible for facts.\\nHere\\'s my other recommendation about meds. There are no medications that repair MS damage, so you\\'re not looking for a fix-it med. (If you are, stop it. ) The purpose of the MS disease-modifying meds is to try to prevent further disease activity/damage and maybe create a quieter environment in which existing nerve damage can heal (maybe, maybe not).\\nEverything with the meds is a trade-off among risks, benefits and individual conveniences. And this is critical: the meds have different rates of statistical effectivity. They have to be viewed by weighing off the best estimate of success vs. the risk taken.\\nThe injectible drugs are first-generation meds that have the lowest statistical rate of effectiveness. Since MS has already hit you so hard, it\\'s probably in your best interest to start with a med with a higher rate of effectiveness. Right now the drug with the highest rate of effectiveness with a reasonably well known risk profile is Tysabri. If you\\'re a candidate for it, would you want to start with a drug that isn\\'t known to work as well?\\nThere are no guarantees because all drug effects are individual. Some people have done very well on the lower-effectivity injectible drugs and some have done terribly on Tysabri, the higher-rated oral meds and the off-label chemo agents. You have to just pick a med and start on it based on your own medical profile and your tolerance for risk vs. benefit.\\nAgain, you have to do your own studying and make your own choices -- without relying on horribly unreliable forum opinions posing as facts and the \"it\\'s too hard to read\" excuse that will lead you into unfortunate shortcuts.\\nThere\\'s a lot of work for you to do.

I am ALL for learning but my brain doesn't seem to be taken in information like it used to. I worked in research and development so I'm not affraid of taking on issues. This is just above my pay scale. I will of course research but half doesn't do any good. Thanks I mean that. Also the info I've read is all over the place. I worked statistics and MS is a statistical nightmare. Lol.\", \"Hi Mark,\\nI am going to give you my personal opinion. It sounds to me that you are having a rough go. The med with the best efficacy is Tysabri. I would check into it and have a thorough conversation with your Neuro-he/she is your professional go to person.\\nI have been on Tysabri for almost 10 years and it has been a G-d send for me.. for some it doesn't work and some it makes them worse. I wish I could have been on it 2 years sooner-for awhile it was pulled from the market and before that it was in a trial.\\nI wish you well !\\nGood luck\", \"Hello all. I don't mean to get off topic. I know I have lesions in my brainstem. The other day I was just standing talking then I just dropped. No warning. No passing out. Like a doll. Lost all control. Is this MS? Is this the crap you all deal with? I know no magic pill... But come on. I just started with MS! Do they make a pill to help me stop complaining.\", \"Originally posted by vender View Post\\nThis is just above my pay scale.\\nHi Mark:\\nIt’s fine to delegate or to buy out technical expertise. We do it all the time, and it’s what we do with medical professionals. And it’s OK to rely on technical experts now, while you’re still in shock, fear, anger and grief.\\nBut there’s no escaping the fact that each one of us is ultimately responsible for ourselves. The quality of your life depends in many ways on the decisions you make, so there can’t be anyone at a higher pay grade than you. Unless you become incompetent, you’re the one who’s responsible for you.\\nYou can delegate, but that’s not a substitute for participation. If you don’t participate, you’re just giving your power away. And the more power you give away, the more you allow yourself to turn into a helpless victim. Is that a road you want to go down?\\nRight now you might think you’re relying on your “awesome” doctors. But I have to wonder how it came to be that your “awesome” doctors didn’t step up and use their skills to take control of your complicated case and make the decisions they should be making for you. Somehow you ended up wandering the Internet by yourself, in situations you shouldn’t be in. That could have been prevented. It’s not surprising that you’re feeling so overwhelmed. So unless that’s how you want to stay, at some point you'll have to start making some decisions for yourself.\\nOriginally posted by vender View Post\\nThe other day I was just standing talking then I just dropped. No warning. No passing out. Like a doll. Lost all control. Is this MS?\\nIt could be MS, but if it is it's a highly atypical presentation.\\nOriginally posted by vender View Post\\nIs this the crap you all deal with?\\nNo, because that isn't how MS generally works.\\nFunctionally, MS is an impairment of the transmission of electrical signals along nerves. Either the transmission is faulty – like along a wire without insulation – or the wires don’t conduct at all. It's a fairly constant environment. It’s not at all typical for electrical impulses to just shut off, causing a fall.\\nIn MS, falls are most often caused by a leg, legs or core muscles being too weak to hold the person up, or by a loss of balance. Falls in MS aren’t caused by dropping for no reason. That sounds more typical of an electrical disruption in the brain, or a seizure.\\nIf I’m remembering correctly, you said you had an EEG that was normal. But the most that can be said for that is that it was normal only for the hour or two you were hooked up to the EEG machine. It doesn't in any way guarantee that something abnormal isn't going on the rest of the time.\\nIt might be a good idea to talk to your neurologist about a 24-hour ambulatory EEG to get a better idea of what’s going on under real-life conditions. MS is known to cause seizures under the right conditions, so the idea can't be written off just because an initial EEG was normal.\\nFor the treatment med, the statistics point to Tysabri for your complicated case. If it agrees with you, it can give you some relief from progression for at least couple of years.\\nFinally, my last recommendation is to urge you to stay as active as you comfortably can, and balance that by learning how to meditate. It will come in really handy later.\", 'Originally posted by jreagan70 View Post\\nHi Mark:\\nIn MS, falls are most often caused by a leg, legs or core muscles being too weak to hold the person up, or by a loss of balance. Falls in MS aren’t caused by dropping for no reason. That sounds more typical of an electrical disruption in the brain, or a seizure.\\nI fall and have the worst balance ever. No more ladders for me. I was having seizure then the steroid infusions stopped them. Now I just collapse.\\nFinally, my last recommendation is to urge you to stay as active as you comfortably can, and balance that by learning how to meditate. It will come in really handy later.\\nI strongly believe if I \"stop doing\" it will be the end of me. I push and push but eventually the body says no more. Meditate? I keep hearing that?

Add to that, sometimes our cognitive abilities are affected by MS or symptoms that interfere with our ability to read, focus, understand, and/or remember. Of course, MS is a very complex disease and the medical community's understanding is still evolving as research progresses.\\nMy suggestion would be to list what is important to you and your lifestyle, and review with your neuro, asking for their expertise the in pros/cons.\\nThe NMSS also has video presentations, which would allow you to listen rather than read.\\nI, like Linda am on Tysabri. I wanted to be on highest efficacy there is. And while not everyone experiences it, some people do see improvement on it. For me, I was progressing, and Ty stabilized. What also appealed to me was an Infusion once every 28 days after years of shots. And I don't have to worry if traveling about shots. But Tysabri requires a 3 hour commitment during week, which not everyone can make due to work, other commitments.\\nThe other caution I have would be about starting new meds at the same time. If you get side effects, you won't know necessarily which med is causing it.\\nI wish you good luck.

Likewise, any tests needed before you could start. Tysabri requires a blood test to check your JC virus titer number.\\nFinally, your insurance may come into play. I know for Tysabri, even though first line DMT now, some plans won't authorize it until you have tried another, but MS still progressed.\\nAgain, good luck.

There have been studies that as little as a 0.5 degree Fahrenheit change can cause symptoms to increase.

Any damage Multiple Sclerosis causes has the potential of getting worse --- over the long haul.\\nBoth her and my neuro Op said I need to live with INO!!\\nYes, this is correct. This can also be true for any symptoms caused by MS\\nIf a person has relapsing/remitting MS it is possible symptoms to resolve. However, remissions can be complete (no symptoms) or partial (residual symptoms) with partial being the most common.\\nLiving with MS also means (for many) living with residual symptoms and/or symptoms that come and go.\\nSo if nothing helps with the internuclear ophthalmoplegia why take DMT\\'s? To stop NEW lesions?\\nI don\\'t take a DMT and never have.\\nThe DMDs/DMTs are to hopefully: slow progression of the disease, reduce lesion load, and reduce the amount and severity of exacerbations (relapse, attack, flare-up). Is it possible to have symptom improvements on a DMD/DMT? Yes, but this is not true for everyone.\\nUsing a DMD/DMT is a personal decision best made as a discussion between you and your Neurologist.\\nSome things for you to think about:\\nIf you choose not to use a DMD/DMT and your disease course progressed or you were having relapses could you live with the past decision of not using a DMD/DMT or would you have regrets for not starting a treatment sooner?\\nIf you would have regrets then you need to use a DMT/DMD.\\nIn choosing not to treat you are choosing to allow your journey with this disease to take it\\'s natural course --- good or bad.\\nBest wishes on your decision', 'Update\\nHello All!

Younger patients and those in the earlier stages of MS remyelinate better on their own than do older patients and those in later stages of MS.\\nA major theory is that recoveries tend to be faster and more complete in RRMS in the early \"faster/better remyelinating\" years, and that secondary progressive develops when bodies lose their ability to remyelinate and recover with time and age.\\nSo it isn\\'t surprising that the effects of Anti-LINGO-1 (opicinumab) are better in conjunction with a body that\\'s doing a lot of the recovery on its own anyway. The other thing that won\\'t be surprising is that, in a body that isn\\'t doing as much remyelinating on its own in older/later stages, the small effect of Anti-LINGO won\\'t be enough to make any difference, and it will end up failing to help, just as it failed to help in the general group of test subjects in the clinical trial.\\n20 year olds who drink soda can run faster than 70 year olds who drink soda.

I\\'m sure you\\'ll find msworld a great help - I know I sure do!\\nI just got back from seeing my new neuro who says PPMS but we need the results from the MRI and/or a LP before an official diagnosis. I just thought I\\'d share my story real quick to give you more sides. As others have already said, everyone is different and please just take each day as it comes instead of living in a future that probably isn\\'t true anyway.\\nI started having noticeable issues about 12 years ago. I\\'m terrible with timing, so that\\'s a guess. My first issue was my right leg. I was very active, and would start out each day with a vigorous 4 mile walk. At the time, my youngest was about 9 years old and I was a single mom. I would bring a different child with me each morning and it was such a nice time for us But I noticed my right leg and foot was getting unusually tired right at the start of our walk. I shrugged it off and thought maybe I just needed new shoes. I kept switching shoes and nothing seemed to help, but still I shrugged it off.\\nThat went on for a few years, and then my whole body just seemed to be breaking down. I was still very active and had a full daily schedule, but found myself not able to keep up, having to rest, take naps, etc. My balance was getting worse and I started falling every so often. Other things began to happen as well. Looking back now it\\'s easy for me to see the problem: I was trying to live like nothing was wrong and that was causing all sorts of stress on the underlying issue and my body was freaking out and protesting.\\nI continued to get worse and eventually (finally) saw a doctor. He said several things, took several tests, and then suggested an MRI to check for things like MS. I had no clue what MS was, so I didn\\'t even really hear him. I did not care much for that doctor, so I found another GP and he\\'s been my GP ever since. At my first appointment, he agreed with the first doctor: MS. I also talked to a friend who was a doctor in another country. MS.\\nI finally saw a neurologist, but because my brain MRIs were clear, nothing much was done. A few other tests and such, but I felt like I was wasting my time. Since doctors made me anxious and my neuro was 3 hours away and I was not getting anywhere, I quit going for 2 or 3 years. I went back again, and then had another break, and so on.\\nFast forward to our current time (for reference, I am 42 years old).\\nIn the past 8 or so years I\\'ve progressed from being seemingly healthy and active, thin and in shape, to needing a cane, walker, wheelchair, or electric buggy (depending on the activity). My activities and responsibilities have been DRASTICALLY cut down by my loved ones and now all I have to do is sit around ... anything else I manage to get done is considered a bonus. Recently I have begun gaining weight, which is so hard for me to cope with. Not being active is finally taking a toll on that side of things. I do my best to eat healthy (I am very health-conscious when it comes to food!), so I think the only way to help myself with weight now is to be careful with portion size and snacking.\\nI have found ways to save energy. I really, really, really want to stay as active and productive as possible, so I just set a timer for 15 to 20 minutes, work on a task at a comfortable pace, and when the timer goes off I sit down and rest as long as I feel I need to. Sometimes I\\'m able to get back up and do another 15 minutes of \\'work\\' after about a half hour of rest, but usually I need to rest for at least an hour before trying to do something else.\\nIt may not sound like much, but in doing things this way I am actually able to get a lot done. In the past I would push myself and then crash for several days. That means getting a lot LESS done.\\nReducing stress as much as possible is so very important. Also, I believe a regular bedtime routine and daily nap is crucial.\\nOther ways of adapting: I sit down as much as possible when doing tasks. Like dishes for example. I never thought I\\'d be sitting down to do dishes, but it sure spares my legs! I ask for help. I lower my standards and expectations of myself. I have grab bars and stools in various trouble areas of my home.\\nI try to stretch every day.\\nBecause of my right side weakness and some confusion, I am not able to drive much. I usually feel safe and able to drive to church and back, but that\\'s it [mostly country roads and about 10 minutes away]. I have a friend that takes me to all of my doctor appointments and does some of my shopping. My daughter helps me out with the rest of the shopping and such.\\nI\\'ve learned that life is not over!! While we may not be able to do all of the things we used to do, we can still find joy! I find joy in gardening, watching birds, and a few other things. My family does all of the hard work in the garden and I just try to go there each morning, set my stool down, and pick weeds for about 15 minutes each day. This is my happy place. Fresh air, birds singing, breeze blowing, sun shining. I get out there as early as possible to avoid the heat and the mosquitos.\\nKeeping a healthy attitude is so vital to your well being. And as others have also said, be careful about anxiety and such. I had not idea that anxiety would be a problem for me, but I find myself getting more anxious as the years go by. This is just not me (well, it is now!!! but it never was in the past). I can tell my loved ones \"I\\'m done\" and they all know what that means. This has been a huge help. Only those who are closest to me have seen me at my worst, so when someone outside of my close circle happens to see me at my worst it\\'s kind of scary for them to witness. \"My worst\" happens when I\\'ve done too much.\\nI found this thread by searching for \"ocrevus\" - my neuro wants me to take it as soon as I am diagnosed and I am just not interested.

She is despondent and I need to help her any way I can. Thank you.\\nHello Swataz and welcome! Thank you for coming to us for the sake of your wife. I was given 5 days of Solu-Medrol IV almost 20 years ago for a nasty flare of optic neuritis. I was not given a taper down schedule. After the 5th day I was feeling horrible! I thought I was having a heart attack, I was filled with anxiety, was crying all the time and I couldn't sleep.\\nIn short, I found out I was having major panic attacks after seeing my pcp who prescribed valium to ease things up and calm me down. It took a day to kick in but helped. However, my vision did not return to near normal for about 6 weeks afterwards and is still somewhat compromised. This is my story - others have different experiences.\\nI have opted to never have another IV treatment after this first time. I never wanted to go through that experience ever again. Nowadays, I hear that a taper down schedule is mostly used. I am sorry your wife is having a hard time and I can certainly empathize with her. It does take time to get back to normal.\\nYou might want to talk with her neuro or primary care doctor and let them know what's going on. In the meantime, be gentle with her - her body is going through a lot of stress. My husband did all the cooking, cleaning and laundry while I recuperated - lucky me!\\nWhen she is feeling better, let her know we'd love to have her check in with us.\\nBoth of you take care and send her good thoughts from MSWorld\", 'My neuro told me today that high dose steroids were linked to necrodisvor decaying of the femur. Could happen on ur first dose or eleventh.', \"Hi Swataz, it's so great of you to reach out on behalf of your wife, she must be really special. Regarding the IV, I am unfamiliar with the dosage your wife is on. If the IV was 1,000 mg per infusion the 1,250 is even more.\\nI've had the IV quite a few times, the last one was approx 2007 so things may have changed since then. My dosage was 1,000 mg IV for 5 days then an oral dose to taper off the med starting at around 5 pills of 80 mg and decreasing the dose until I'm down to 1 mg for a few days. I was told that 1,000 mg is a dangerously high dose to just stop so the oral taper was needed.\\nRegardless, the entire IV/oral experience is nothing short of horrible. During the IV part, I can't sleep, have endless energy, anger easy (I'm normally such a mellow lady) and eat my face off. After the IV comes out I just crash for a few days, no high dose med to keep me awake plus all the false energy I wasted on the IV comes back to haunt me. Also I was warned to stay away from people that are sick with the flu, cold, etc. The high dose is meant to shut down your immune system (so it stops attacking and keep reducing inflammation). It just makes it very easy to catch something.\\nI know it's hard to believe that when she feels this horrid things are improving but it may take a wee while for her to get through the side effects of the med. I used to say that the entire IV/oral treatment made me feel worse than my MS did but things really did improve. Only once out of approx 8 treatments did my affected body part not respond favourably, my left eye only sees light and shadows but it couldn't even see that much before the treatment.\\nI wish the 2 of you well with this, please don't be shy here, there's so much great advice from all angles.\\nJen\", \"Hi, I had four days of solu-medrol - the dosage was very high, followed by an oral taper. Sorry I don't have the exact amounts. I had it for optic neuritis where I completely lost the vision in one eye (the infusion helped).\\nI did not have a horrible experience. However, I read up about how to possibly avoid bad side effects. I simply reduced sodium and sugar intake to nearly zero, unless it was natural in what I was eating. I also kept pretty low fat. I hydrated like I had the flu, and I rested as much as possible.\\nThe first day of steroids made me feel like a million bucks, but I guess that's because I was relapsing and they helped with inflammation and some stabbing neuritis pain in my eye also was relieved pretty quickly. The taper was ok - the hardest part was modifying my diet because I had read that salty food can make you feel terrible when you're on steroids, but that the urge to snack salty foods is indeed powerful.\\nWishing you and your wife the best.\", \"I did 3 days of high dose (1000mg/day) IV steroids for three days a year ago.

I did no oral taper.\\nI had none of the usual steroid side effects: no blood sugar issue, no swelling/water retention, no insomnia, no increased appetite, no mood swings. I just felt bad...……….like a low grade flu. Tired. achy, lack of appetite and wanted to stay in bed all the time, yet I continued to work full time.\\nI had never had steroid infusions before, so I'm not sure how much they helped.

While it\\'s possible that your wife has had only one lesion in her brain in all this time, it\\'s also possible that there have been other lesions at other times, but that one has been the only one present at the time of her MRIs so is the only one that was ever captured in an image.\\nIt\\'s well known that lesions, particularly small ones, can come and go on their own over time.

If no other significant lesions have shown up over 17 years, there may not be any significant lesions in the future that will cause spasticity. That\\'s not a guarantee, but it\\'s a reasonable assumption to make based on 17 years of history.\\nIt\\'s also reasonable to assume that that one lesion is acting as lesions do over time and causing more symptoms as the nerves affected by the lesion deteriorate. The continuing decline of the nerve cells can cause new symptoms even though the lesion looks the same on MRI.\\nSo that part of your wife\\'s history is not unusual -- normal and expected progression of MS (even only one lesion!) over time leading to new symptoms. Even with treatment medications available over the last 15 years, some people with MS still transition to the secondary progressive stage at about 15 years. It sounds like that\\'s what\\'s happening in your wife\\'s case.\\nAlso, spasticity is very common in people with MS. So your wife\\'s case isn\\'t at all unusual in that respect. It doesn\\'t really matter how many lesions are causing the spasticity or where they are. The treatment options are the same -- medications that include a nerve \"quieter,\" a muscle relaxer, or a combination of both. Other things like physical therapy, judiciously applied heat, or massage can help prevent or relieve some people\\'s spasticity. But spasms that occur at night and affect sleep seem to respond best to the regular and continuous taking of medication so that a steady-state level (as much as possible) can be achieved that will carry the prevention or reduction of spasticity through the night.\\nI had one very large spinal cord lesion 15 years ago that has resolved to the point that it\\'s not visible on my MRIs anymore, but the leg spasms -- particularly at night -- have remained.

Then, my PCP was prescribing 10mg of Percocet per month +1 1/2mg of Xanax.\\nI asked my doctor if she was worried about addiction. She kept assuring me that it was ok. Then I got a jaw infection that required two months of IV antibiotics in the hospital. I was prescribed 2mg of dilaudid every 3 hours. As the jaw healed, I was still asking for dilaudid. They asked me what hurt. I said my eye., maybe at that point I was experiencing rebound pain I still don\\'t know.\\nAfter I got out of the hospital, I was still taking the 10mg Percocet. First, once a day, then 2 times, then, every eight hours. I was dependent and I knew a tolerance was building but the terrible achy feeling of MS was something I just didn\\'t want to feel.\\nMy PCP didn\\'t want to keep prescribing to me so she sent me to a pain management doctor.\\nHis office was wonderful. It was in the a Cancer Center which was a beautiful building. I had a great experience with him and over the four years we seemed to building a good relationship based on trust.\\nThen, I went to my October appointment at the Cancer Center and his office was GONE. They gave me his new address so,I hobbled over there in the heat. Finally made it there and they rushed me into a tiny office with a man sitting at the desk. My beloved pain doctor was angry and said, \"YOU ARE LATE!\" I had just lost 15 minutes going to the wrong office. He was talking really fast about now they had a new system. I would have to come every month and all prescriptions would be sent electronically.\\nSo I went to my November appointment on time, hoping he would be in a better mood. He said, well I\\'m going to have to test you now. That was the first time he had ever tested me without a month\\'s advance notice. I wasn\\'t worried because I take my medication the way I am supposed to.\\nWell, in December I go in for my appointment. I came a half hour early so I wouldn\\'t be late and he kept me waiting an hour after the appointment time. He walks in with his laptop, doesn\\'t say hello, looks at the results of my test and says, are you taking any barbiturates? I said, \" I was taking Donatol but they don\\'t make it anymore.\" He said, \"well your barbiturate level,was 5000. The maximum it should be is 50. Would you like to take the test again to see if it\\'s,out of your system? I said, no thank you.\\nWhen I left the office I was scared. I know for sure I did not have barbiturates in my system that day. What if he tests me again and it shows up something illegal and I get arrested? He obviously has a bogus lab. Anything could happen. I talked to the office manager who has been very approachable lately. She told me others patients have come to her upset about the lab results. She says she wants to change labs. But for. me the doctor patient relationship has been severely damaged.\\nI don\\'t know what to do.

I always make the medication last longer than the Rx allows so they know I am not taking too many or selling them or ?\\nSo now I have to see my GP, who as my lead Doc manages the pain meds, which I never understood as they tested everything and concluded I was having pain as a result of MS. He already sent an email saying I needed to be seen at least twice per year and take urine tests. He didn't say what all they are testing for but I assume most everything?\\nI really don't want to subject myself to regular trips to the hospital as I am trying to work a few more years while I'm still able.

The PM doc and I had a cordial doc/patient relationship. His knowledge of MS pretty limited, but he always wrote my refills 3 refills, one rx on three seperate scrips to accomodate my MS.\\nThe nursing staff on the other hand play the 'bad cop' while the PM doc played the role of 'good cop'. I found the good cop/bad cop totally alien to anything I'd ever experienced, it totally bewildered me. But, I'd never had a urinalysis during my 4yrs as a patient there, because I complied with the terms of the PM treatment contract.\\nMy PM doc also moved to a new location. I have visual spatial deficites, I get lost easy even in familiar places, stores, etc. The first couple of appointments after the docs moved, I would get horribly lost, paniced, but I was determined to at least show up for my appointment even if only out of courtesy.\\nI explained to the receptionist that I realized I was late, was extremely sorry, and understood if they had to reschedule my appointment. Explained that the relocation combined with the spatial skills problems, were cognitively incompatiable for me. (To say the nursing staff must have received their training in the state prison is putting it mildly.)\\nEventually there was a mix up in the number of refills, and I left the office with 2 refills versus the usual 3 refills. When I called the office to request the 3rd refill, explaining the error made on the earlier rx, the refil was refused. I was given an appointment for later in the week.\\nMy decades of insomnia was now complicated by the increased pain over the next few days. I always seemed to wait until early AM to take sleep meds, which naturally only make me hung over and sleep deprived the following day for my appointment.\\nI was sleep deprived and hung over, just a mess when I showed up for the appointment to clear up the error made on my previous rx, 2 refills versus the usual 3 refills. I brought a copy of the original rx I request from the pharmacy to document the error.\\nWhen I showed up for the appointment, there was a derigatory comment about my balance problems, lack of focus/blood shot eyes, and despite being properly dressed and groomed, I was obviously distressed from the sleep med hang over combined with being sleep deprived and the stress I anticipated during this office visit that was clearly developing into a showdown with a doc I previously had a very good relationship with.\\nI was immediately escorted to the office building bathroom by a nurse, standing guard out side of the bathroom stall, for a urnine test. I wasn't allowed to have my purse with me!It was a humilating experience.\\nI knew I wouldn't be returning to this doc, but I agreed to the urine test because I waned documentation in my file that my urine was clean per the terms of PM treatment contract.\\nI went for my next neuro appointment about 2 months later, explained the 2 versus 3 refills misunderstanding at the PM clinic, and my neuro refilled the pain med rx.\\nIt didn't take very long for my neuro's hospital plan to establish a PM clinic, which I was referred to. As usual, I was sleep deprived and experiencing mild balance problems.\\nThe receptionist commented about my obvious state of poor balance, bloodshot eyes and impaired coordination. Explaining that I have MS with chronic insomnia, ineffective sleep med complications and balance problems made no impression what so ever. I was a marked woman already.\\nThings deterioted quickly once I saw the PM doc during the initial visit. There were obvious cultural and english second language differences that contributed to a very awakard first and last appointment with the PM doc.\\nThere was some PM doc grunting sounds, deep disapproving breaths and other non verbal negative judgments when she looked at my bottle of pain meds.\\nAgain I agreed to the urine test in order for my records to reflect that I had nothing in my system other than 2 non narcotic meds rx'ed by my MS doc, knowing I wouldn't be returning to the PM clinic.\\nI was not only offended by the PM Contract as 'medical care', I couldn't afford additional cost of monthly visits for another specialist and the cost of monthly labs.\\nI couldn't rely on being able to comply with the terms of the PM Contract demands for monthly OVs. It's necessary for me to break up grooming and personal hygine preperations for my Neuro visists over 2 days because of fatigue, insomnia, etc., and I only see my neuro every 3 months, MRIs 3x a year.\\nThe constant pain is very difficult to contend with day to day, in addition to the negative consequences on my physical and mental well being. I'm near the threshold for tolerating it much longer.\", \"I forgot to mention that doc offices make their share of mistakes, errors, etc. I've experienced 2 very serious oversights by my MS doc's office.\\nOne involved postponing my monthly TY infusion while I was evaluated for PML based on a new, serious mobility issue. I got a call from my Neuro that I had changes on MRIs, first in 8-10yrs, but no PML. No discussion about when I would resume infusions. I assumed it would be handled by the MS doc staff. After all I can't call the infusion center asking where's my TY when infusions were suspended by my doc.\\nThat call never came, so I called my neuro's office, left a voice message about resuming my Ty infusion. I got a voice mail from a nurse asking what rx refill did I need.\\nA few more days of voice mail/phone tag, and almost 60 days since my last Ty infusion with the danger of a Rebound exacerbation looming. I finally got the Ty appointment. That was not the only potentially huge 'office admin' problem I experienced over the years. But I'm not nit-picky, I realize office staff changes, short staffed due to illness, things happen even in my usually very well run MS docs office.\\nAll that to say that doc offices make errors all the time, including MS docs and PM docs.\\nSo when I look at the PM Clinic Patient Compliance Contract necessary to continued pain treatment, it's strikes me as more than a bit ironic. Even hipacratic/sp?, to put the patient to such high compliance standards, with the patient always under threat, even when an office error is responsible, or the standards in the contract are inconpitable, unrealistic for some patients.\\nThe patient is the offender under suspition, regardless of the circumstances. That relization led me to the decision that despite daily pain, deteriotating physical and mental health as a result, it was not in my best interest to continue treatment at this time.\", 'My GP has always been the one who prescribed my pain med.

Of course he didn\\'t have any appts for weeks, but I had my \"standing\" drug Rx appt. so I was in good shape because that also became my pneumonia follow up appt.\\nHowever, I was struck with the ridiculousness (is that a word?) last appt at GP. It was late on a Friday, and for some reason he wasn\\'t there so I saw the NP. Of course the NP couldn\\'t give me the RX for the pain med, it had to be signed by the GP...so I had to go back the next week to pick up the RX. Fortunately, I wasn\\'t completely out of the med, but if I had been, I would have had to go three days without it (I was there on a Friday afternoon and the office doesn\\'t open till 9 on Monday...so that would have been a painful weekend.\\nAnother new thing...when my husband drops my RX off at the pharmacy, he has to have my ID...just to drop it off.

Don’t take them all, and you’re hoarding so you can take more all at once to get high.\\nTell them your pain is an 8, and you’re not hurting enough to need meds. Tell them it’s a 10, and you’re exaggerating.\\nComport yourself in a normal, rational manner, and you must not be in that much pain. Come off as agitated or depressed, and you need group therapy—no pain meds for you.\\nAnd as someone up-thread said, things can be written into your record easily and without your knowledge. All it takes is one self-righteous, vindictive, or sadistic doctor, nurse, or PA who is having a bad day and you’re done. No chance for appeal or redemption. God help you if they cut you off when you’ve built up a dependency—it’s off to a detox unit with you.\\nI don’t know about you, but I am so sick of living under this medical terrorism.

(thread here: http://www.msworld.org/forum/showthr...rogressive-MS)\\nSo of course I\\'ve been reading whatever I can find about it, and look at this:\\n\"Ibudilast crosses the blood–brain barrier and suppresses glial cell activation. This activity has been shown to make ibudilast useful in the treatment of neuropathic pain and it not only enhances analgesia produced by opioid drugs, but also reduces the development of tolerance.\"\\nNot only that, but another trial of Ibudilast is seeking to address opioid abuse, and says this:\\n\"</not>Recent preclinical studies demonstrate that while ibudilast increases the analgesic effects of opioids, it decreases the rewarding effects of such drugs. It has also been shown that ibudilast suppresses morphine-induced release of dopamine, a primary neurotransmitter involved in the rewarding and reinforcing effects of abused drugs.\"\\nIn other words, maybe we could have a pain med that in itself, relieves pain, and also helps opioids relieve pain better with a lower dose, while at the same time reduces the desire to abuse them. Doesn\\'t this sound like a huge game-changer in pain management to you?\\nSo where are all these ultra-concerned people who are so worried about pain medication abuse? Why aren\\'t they jumping up and down, hollering about how we should research combining Ibudilast with opioids to see if we can\\'t come up with an effective pain reliever that reduces drug abuse risk? Aren\\'t they clamping down pain meds only because they really care about our well-being? Yeah, I never bought that, either.', \"All the horror stories make me feel very blessed.\\nSince the regulations came into effect the only change for me is I have to go to the office to pick up a paper script once a month instead of them giving me 1 + 5 refills. With difficulties getting around that is annoying but nothing like what you folks are running into.\\nI am sure it helps that I have been seeing the same PCP for 7 years and using the same pharmacist for even longer. I started out at 2 5mg vicodin a day and now after 7 years I am up to 4 5mg a day. Every time I needed to bump up the script I just told my doctor and he did it. I am not sure how that will go if I need another increase with the new regulations on the books. I have actually been weaning down to most days only 3 a day so I hope to never have to cross that bridge.\\nAs far as the new regulations go there is NO mandatory drug test involved. The only effective change is that doctors can not write refills, and all scripts must be written out no phoning them in any longer. IF your doctor is requiring a drug test or any other hoops that is them not the DEA. Unfortunately for those who's doctors are requiring such things it will be very difficult to change doctors at this point as it would instantly make you appear to be a drug seeker. It is important to know your rights though just to give you confidence when dealing with your doctor. I know it is hard to stand up to a doctor and could ruin the relationship but honestly if your doctor is acting like that the relationship is already ruined.\\nOne other thing I will add. I smoke pot both to help me sleep at night, to reduce muscle spasms and for the neuroprotective properties. I am not in a medical marijuana state but both my PCP and my Neurologist know that I smoke. That being the case a drug test would screw me royally so I am very cautions about what I agree to at the doctors office.

I'm sorry, I know how painful and debilitating that spasticity can be. I was considering Botox, but eventually decided on a Baclofen pump. I'll tell you what little I do know about Botox.\\nBotox is injected directly into the muscles and relaxes muscles by disrupting the communication between the brain and muscles. Botox does this by attaching to nerve endings and prevents them from transmitting signals to the muscles that eventually cause spasms. The number of injections required will be determined by the area treated. Electrical impulses may be used to ensure the injections are working properly. The injection benefits are normally realized a few days after the procedure and then lasts from 3-6 months. The procedure is then repeated every few months to maintain the effectiveness.\\nSince, I never tried Botox, I cannot discuss any experienced benefits or side effects. What I can say, is that when my spasticity was removed so was the related pain. I had no idea how much spasticity was truly impacting my quality of life. If you have tried PT, stretching, oral anti-spasticity medications, acupuncture, massage, and other treatments have failed, then you have many options left. Trying Botox would be an experiment that lasted a few months. If you don't like the results, you could stop with relatively little residual damage. Make sure you clearly understand your costs before agreeing to the treatment.\\nPlease update us when you can, and I hope whatever treatment you decide on will serve you well.\\nYou can read more about Botox here: http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Tre...ications/BOTOX\", \"Thanks for the well wishes and the information, Marco.\\nActually my spasticity has been well managed on Baclofen.

Amazing how MS hardships better prepare you for other areas of your life. Again, Congratulations!\\nI cannot comment on Botox and pregnancy. I believe it has not been studied so that conversation is completely between you and your doctor.\\nWhat I do know, is that Botox does not travel far from the injection site and far less travels in your blood. That's why it can be used in the face because it travels so little distance from the injection site. So if your injection location is limited, that is exactly what Botox is supposed to help. Based on what you said, it does appear that you match the Botox criteria and match it well. If you proceed, I hope it works amazingly well for you. Please keep us update.

The FDA doesn't choose what a drug is used for. The use is chosen by the patent holder/manufacturer in their new drug application.\\nThe use is chosen by the applicant. The applicant presents clinical data that, it is hoped, demonstrates that the drug is safe (which is a relative term) and effective for the use being applied for. The FDA then approves or rejects the drug for that specific use. The FDA has no influence over what use is chosen, or the use the drug is approved for, other than to agree that the drug is safe and effective for that use.\\nBecause drug trials cost multi-millions of dollars, drug companies limit the number of uses applied for in order to keep the cost of the trials down. If there is the potential of profit for other uses, the company will then run more clinical trials for the second purpose. It has to apply for the additional use(s) separately.\\nAn example of this is Ampyra, which is approved only to increase walking speed. There doesn't appear to be any potential for profit in testing and applying for another other use.\\nAnother example is Tysabri. After it was approved for MS, Biogen did separate trials and applied separately for its approval for treatment of Crohn's disease. Obviously there was the potential for profit in using it to treat another disease.\\nThe specific use(s) for a drug is part of the drug's labeling. The FDA doesn't forbid use of drugs off-label, but it forbids drug companies to advertise or in any way promote off-label uses.\\nOnce a drug loses patent protection and goes generic, there's no motivation for anyone to do clinical trials to get a new use approved. They can't get another patent for that use because it's the same drug, and there's no way to make back the money that would be spent on drug trials.\\nNor does the FDA have any influence over what drugs insurance companies put on their formularies or what uses of the drugs the insurers cover.\\nSo that's why the FDA can't be pressured to add an approved use to force an insurer to cover the cost of a drug.

Your double vision resolved when the damaged nerves were able to recover their function in an environment of reduced inflammation. The steroids didn\\'t do anything to heal the nerves or restore your vision. Because steroids don\\'t do any healing, they have NO effect on the final outcome of a flare. Research has shown many times that the end result of a flare is the same whether the flare is treated with steroids or not treated with steroids at all.\\nThe mistake people make about steroids is that they think steroids affect the final outcome. They don\\'t. So there\\'s no reason to treat with steroids if the only hope is that they\\'ll \"work\" and \"make it better.\" The benefit to steroids is that they *can* -- but there\\'s no guarantee -- reduce the healing *time* and shorten the duration of the symptoms. And they do that by providing that quieter environment that allows the body\\'s own healing processes to take place. And when someone has extensive debility from a flare -- like you do -- there\\'s great benefit in restoring (or trying to) as much function as possible as quickly as possible.\\nSo THAT\\'S why your flare was treated with steroids. In your position I would have done exactly the same thing. And I have done it several times. Here\\'s the critical point. IF not a lot of damage has been done and steroids are administered quickly, that quieter environment can allow nerves to heal quickly and fairly completely. BUT IF too much damage has already taken place before the steroids are administered, there\\'s too much damage to overcome and the nerves can\\'t heal.\\nSometimes healing is actually fairly complete, just slow. Sometimes the amount of healing is limited because some of the damage is *already* permanent. Sometimes all of the damage is permanent and there is little to no recovery. All of that damage happened independent of the steroids, and there\\'s nothing steroids can do because they don\\'t heal anything on their own. And when steroids don\\'t do something they aren\\'t supposed to do and can\\'t do, it can\\'t be said that they didn\\'t \"work.\"\\nOriginally posted by pyrmama2 View Post\\nI did 4 days of solu-medrol and it did absolutely nothing. It\\'s been 5 months and I\\'m not better.\\nI think we\\'ve established that the Solu-Medrol probably did quite a lot of what it does. It just wasn\\'t what you wanted it to do. So you can let them off the hook now. :-) Five months isn\\'t really enough time to recover from a body-wide flare. That\\'s not realistic. Recovery can take years. It took me *8* years to recover from a large spinal cord injury. Your body *wants* to recover, and it will to some degree if you give it a chance. But it can\\'t if you keep going back and re-embedding the injury by focusing on it over and over and over. Instead, try embedding your *recovery* by talking about THAT over and over and over. Your brain will go after whatever you tell it to go after. So why not tell it to go after something you want instead of something you don\\'t?', 'Hi pyrmama2,\\nFor weakness you might consider working with a Physical Therapist(PT).

It was my first flare, the one that led to the DX, so I didn't know about the oral.\\nThis is making that mistaken implication that steroids -- and in particular an oral taper -- have some effect on the final outcome of a flare. Research has shown that steroids have NO effect on the final outcome of a flare.\\nFurther research has shown that an oral taper also has NO effect on the outcome of a flare, and oral tapers are no longer recommended. If anything, the additional steroid ingested with a taper adds to the risk of additional steroid damage -- diabetes, bone death, osteoporosis, glaucoma -- for no benefit. Does that taper still sound like a good idea?\\nThe practice of oral steroid tapers came from diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis that sometimes show rebound flares of inflammation after sudden cessation of high dose steroids. Many years of use of high-dose steroids in MS have shown that MS doesn't have rebound flares. No rebound, no need for a taper. Doctors who don't keep up with practice recommendations might still prescribe tapers, but they're not in the patients' best interest.\\nI take high-dose steroids 4 times a year and I haven't done a taper in at least 10 years. My doctor wouldn't prescribe one even if I asked for it.\\nAnd certainly, long-lasting effects after a flare has nothing to do with whether a relatively small taper was done 5 months before.\\nSo no benefit plus additional risk of harm has eliminated the outdated practice of an oral steroid taper.\", 'Sorry to hear, it also left me with the side effects, but it works in the short run.

Because the side effects can't clear up quickly, they might seem different.\\nOriginally posted by Ikaika View Post\\nDoctor and Pharmacist said the 200mg ER is a 24 hour release tablet. But the paperwork that come with the Rx say 12 hour. Anyone in the know?\\nYou would do better to rely on the scientific information in the prescribing information, which has been reviewed and approved by the FDA.\\nYour doctor and pharmacist are correct that the ER formula has the capability of releasing something over 24 hours. But that doesn't at all mean that the tablets release a perfectly metered amount of medication that is exactly the same over 24 hours and that the med only needs to be taken once every 24 hours. (I can see how your doctor may not understand this, but your pharmacist should know better.)\\nThe amount of medication varies over the 24 hours, and the level peaks in the blood somewhere between 3 and 12 hours (which could be why you're waking up swollen and puffy if you take it at bedtime). And that's why, in regular usage, the ER version is taken 2X a day instead of once -- because the peak level should be renewed every 12 hours, not every 24. The normal/conventional tablets peak at about 4-5 hours, and they're usually taken 4X a day to renew the peak level about every 4-5 hours.\\nOriginally posted by Ikaika View Post\\nThis med seems to be the best choice out of all the other ines for me, so I'm trying to figure how to take it and not swell back up like a balloon.\\nIf your body can't release the extended edema that may come with the extended-release med, you may not be a candidate for the ER version. The normal, quicker-acting med may allow the edema to dissipate quickly so it doesn't accumulate and you don't swell up, but the trade-off may be that you'll have to take the med more often. But that might not be so bad if you can get the benefits of the med without accumulated side effects.\", \"Update from my above response about having reaction to tegretol and coming off it.

I\\'ve had MS since the beginning of time, and it started before they had DMD\\'s, so I\\'m a mess.\\nMy fatigue has graduated to that level known as \"crippling fatigue.\" I don\\'t need to describe it, I\\'m sure. I am still walking, with braces on both legs, as my feet no longer evert. I use a walker, walls, husband\\'s jeans waistband, what ever it takes to walk. The neuro has said that people like me, who are still walking in spite of a large disease load, are the patients who have off-the-charts fatigue. So, hurrah for still walking.\\nRecently my neuro suggested Aderall, which I had tried and hated many years ago. But, since my fatigue is so much worse now, we thought it may be worth a try. So, I took my 10 mg tablet at 9 on the first day. And, it did give me more focus (I sewed for three hours!). It did not make me feel energetic, it just made me feel like I could do things in spite of the fatigue. And, so I did. And, I paid for that with a great increase in what is already \"crippling\" pain. And, I could not sleep well that night, with a racing feeling lingering from the Aderall. The dosage did give me side effects of racing heart, anxiety, dry mouth, the usual.\\nNot one to give up, I got up on day #2 and took my little pill at 8 a.m. And, I had the same results, I sewed for 4 hours! along with some other things. And, I ended up in great pain. And, again I did not sleep well at all.\\nThis morning I got up and I felt like I HAD to take that pill. Now there\\'s a feeling I do not want. So, I took 1/2 (5 mgs) and it provided little benefit. So, here I am, fogged out and trashed at 1 p.m., as usual. Soon I will do my usual lay down on the couch which pretty much marks the end of my productivity for the day aside from knitting in the evening.\\nI am conflicted because I know that Aderall is Meth and Meth is not a drug to sneeze at. Addiction is rampant with this med, (and I am a 25 year recovered alcoholic) as are long-term side effects and changes in one\\'s brain. Weaning off of it can be a beast. However, I sewed for 4 hours! And that was such a good feeling, to be in my sewing room, doing what I do. However, I do not want to have that feeling at the expense of the health of my brain and personality. If I do stay on it and it continues to interrupt my sleep (in spite of a bomb of pills I take to sleep) then it is game over anyhow.\\nI am seriously considering stopping this drug all together before I get in too deep. It\\'s so tough, though, as without this pill, I\\'ve got nothing to work with. I do all I can in a day, and just drag on.

I took provigil for I think maybe 3-4 months. It gave me what I call a fake awake. No energy really just wired but a tired wired. Like I was awake 18 hours and just downed 3 coffees. It also interacted with my birth control so I had to stop taking it. I then tried adderal. I was so high I felt I could rule the world. No extra energy just determination I could do anything....until the crash...then I couldn\\'t do a thing and I was so down in the dumps. Now I know why people take it recreationally but the crash is too depressing to make it worthwhile.\\nI totally can get what you are going through. The drug allows you to ignore your body only to pay the price later. High highs then low lows. I couldn\\'t handle the rollercoaster. The highs were not worth the consequences. So I say dump it. Or see if there are more controlled released versions so maybe instead of giving you the drive to sew for 4 hrs you can only do 2 in the am and 2 in the PM. I\\'ve recently begun researching ADHD drugs for my daughters impending diagnosis and was surprised all the different stimulants there are now that have slower more controlled releases.\\nI think your asking because you know what you should do but feel you are betraying \"what ifs\" if you give it up. Go with your gut.', 'Aderol-my experience\\nI have had a similar background with the \"ever increasing\" fatigue throughout the years. In the past, I tried everything that has been mentioned (provigil, nuvigel, Ritalin, several others, including aderol. Like you describe now, none worked and they made me too jittery. So, after many many trials, I just stopped trying to help my fatigue. About 5 years passed and my fatigue had become completely debilitating. I was at the point of not being able to function and as we know, the quality of life keeps decreasing, as more functionality that is lost. So my Dr and I revisited it.\\nI tried aderol for the second time. It did take a couple weeks or so to adjust, but I don\\'t have the jittery side effects that I had 5 years ago with the first try. I also have insomnia (have had for 16 years), so I was scared it would keep me up. My Ms Specialist prescribed 10mg aderol twice a day and told me to NOT take the second dose after 3 so it would reduce chances of effecting sleep.\\nAt first, I tried just taking the morning 10mg dose, but like you mentioned, the crash comes unforgivingly around mid afternoon and my fatigue was worse than even imaginable!\\nI wasn\\'t sure about taking it at all for these reasons, and I knew a second 10 mg dose would keep me up at night. So, I tried taking 1/2 tablet at 2:30-3 pm and it is working out very well now (for about 3 months now). My fatigue is still worse in the afternoon and evening (compared to mornings), but it\\'s ok with me to ensure I don\\'t stay awake all night. I have to set my phone alarm for my 5mg dose in afternoon because if I forget it, I just can\\'t function at all afternoons/evening. And, I absolutely will NOT take the medicine after 3! If I forget it, (and I have, despite turning my alarm off), I just make it through to the next day and accept my worsened condition.\\nThis is just my experience and I know everyone is different. My b/p has always been very good thankfully, and the aderol did not effect that.\\nIt is helping me, esp in mornings, to at least get some basic things done. To me, it is more depressing to only be able to lay on couch or bed for biggest % of day. And that\\'s how bad it was getting for me as well. For me, the inability to get anything done effected my sense of self worth greatly. So, I\\'m lucky that for now, it is helping me.\\nI hope you find the right solution that will help you and improve your quality of life. And, just because it is working for me at the present, we never know what our next days will be like, so I, too, try to just do the best I can each day. My faith in God has been a huge factor in getting me through difficult times!! Best of wishes to you.', \"Hi Marie and thank you for sharing your experience. It certainly is worthwhile to retry a med that may have been difficult in years gone by. As this disease worsens, the effect of drugs can change.\\nI had tried Adderall in 2012 and that was a disaster but I tried again because I am at that point where I am debilitated by fatigue and also by pain. I thought my fatigue was bad in 2012, silly me.\\nI came back to finish my story, as I started this thread and wanted to finish it in case people look to it for advice. I'm glad you added your story.\\nI kept trying. Taking 5 mg morning, 5 mg at 1 or 10 mg morning, 5 mg mid day.\\nI did this for a month. I had to stop for two reasons: the crash did not lighten, it seemed to only get worse. Depression unlike anything I have ever known. And, the second thing was a big surprise to me: Heartburn. Like the depression, unlike any I have ever known. The neuro had me taking double doses of Nexium and others 2 x a day. No coffee, tea, chocolate, tomatoes, etc. The heartburn just did not stop. It was horrid and the neuro decided it may be related to my difficulty swallowing, which often leaves traces of food in my throat. I do tend to get heartburn easily anyhow. So, I drank buckets of water to wash everything down.... which of course filled my gut too much and increased reflux. I was caught in a terrible circle. I kept trying. I had swallowing studies and a scope done of my esophagus, which showed I was developing Barrett's esophagus from all of this madness. So, that was that.\\nWhen on Adderall, I never really felt energized, I just felt exhausted but able to do things. And, I could not nap because of the Adderall buzz, even though I felt drained. And, because I could do more, my pain increased.\\nSuch a tangled web.\\nThis med is so useful for so many people, but I'm not one of them. I'd encourage people suffering from fatigue to try it. You just never know what med will agree with you and which will not, until you try.\", 'Hello fellow MSers\\nI have my new ampyra prescription and I am wondering with the seizure risk should I be safe starting this med while caring for my grandbaby? How long will it take before I am out of the woods so to say with the seizure risk? I fear something happening while I care for her.\\nthank you!', \"Hi BDOBBINS,\\nI'm wondering if you have talked to prescribing Dr. about this and what risks did s/he say?\\nHere's what the FDA says:\\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is updating health care professionals and the public about the risk of seizures in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who are starting Ampyra (dalfampridine). Using information received from post-market adverse event reports, FDA recently evaluated seizure risk in MS patients taking Ampyra (dalfampridine). The majority of seizures happened within days to weeks after starting the recommended dose and occurred in patients having no history of seizures.\\nIn addition, FDA is updating the Ampyra drug label to clarify recommendations that kidney function should be checked in patients before starting Ampyra and monitored at least annually while Ampyra treatment continues. Additionally, patients who miss a dose should not take extra doses—an extra dose of Ampyra can increase seizure risk.\\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm312846.htm\\nSometimes I help babysit my grandchild along with her other grandma and I can understand your concern. If your grandchild is old enough to call 911 on their own just in case you do have a seizure, you can be better equipped and somewhat more confident in babysitting alone.\\nI took Ampyra awhile back for 6 months. It didn't help my walking at all, so I quit. I never had a seizure, but we are all different! Please don't take any others experience as guidance, and talk with your Dr.\\nI hope you can work this all out. Maybe have another adult with you to help babysit while you start Ampyra?

He really wants me to take baclofen, but it makes me way too sleepy and I think it makes my tremor and balance worse.

I am not a doctor and I learned about this compounded drug through several websites. Knuckle , on this board, has posted about this drug many times. I have been taking it for several years. There is a lot to learn about prescribing and treating with this drug. I hope that you can find a doctor to prescribe it for you.

I've heard that there are very few doctors that will prescribe it. That's unfortunate as I've also heard that is very effective for MS fatigue.\\nMy neuro prescribed LDN a couple years ago for me. I tried it, but had to stop because it caused so much fatigue for me. I was really dragging until I stopped.\\nCurrently I'm taking 50mg of Provigil daily. At first it was pure magic, but now it's not working as well as it did when I first started, so I'm probably going to increase my dosage and see if that works better.\\n/Scut\", 'Nuvigil wakes up my brain\\nBefore Nuvigil I would wake up after nine or more hours of sleep; drink a cup of coffee in silence and and fall asleep on the couch for at least another hour. Any chores would be done in spurts \"had to chuckle when I saw that description\" Even more than physical fatigue I was suffering from brain fatigue. I could not carry on a conversation..at least not one that was intelligible! Everyone would ask me if I was angry with them. That question is way to difficult to answer when my brain isn\\'t awake! No! didn\\'t seem to be an adequate response.!\\nMy original dosage was 175 mg a day. But from what I hear from family and friends, when I took the full dosage it was like I was vaccinated with a phonograph needle. I have settled on a half of a pill a day. 1/4 in the morning and a 1/4 after lunch. I still lay down and rest cause I figure my body needs it, but I get a little bounce out of the afternoon dosage. I was diagnosed with MS 8 years ago and have been taking Nuvigil for almost 3 years. Thanks to Nuvigil I have an a almost normal life. I\\'m just thankful for the ability to engage with my surroundings.', \"Has anyone ever had botox for spasticity in their lower jaw and/or mouth?\\nI have a spastic tongue, had it for years. It was my presenting symptom 20 years ago, before the idea of MS ever came into the picture. Now we know it's MS, and always has been, because I have a lesion in the area of the lower cranial nerves that affect the tongue.\\nI've managed it for years with low dose benzos, Baclofen (I still take a low dose of baclofen even though I have a pump..but I take this for my jaw/tongue and upper body spasticity.)\\nThe pain is only on one side of my tongue, but my speech has become pretty impaired. I used to be able to distract myself from the pain, but that's not working anymore, I've tried every neurogenic pain med there is, but they don't work because it's really not sensory pain, it's plain old muscle spasm/spasticity pain...so now we're looking into botox.\\nBotox had been recommended years ago by a neuro but all the 2nd opinions from other neuros I trusted said only do it when all else has failed. So I'm about at that point where I'm going to have to do something, or quit talking and chewing...that's what triggers the spasm. The caveat to just going ahead and doing it has always been, it could make the situation worse, speaking and swallowing at least.\\nI've had a swallow test, I've been to a speech therapist, and my swallowing is okay, some deficits, but okay. Speech therapist says there is nothing speech therapy can do for me.\\nBut it's either going to be heavier pain med, no talking, soft foods only, or some other type of treatment, so botox is being investigated. I've been referred to the neuro in the practice that does EMGs, so I think that will be the next move just to see what nerves are firing and which aren't...I have fasciculations on the one side of my tongue that never stop and muscles of my jaw and neck have atrophied quite a lot.\\nGood news is: botox results only last 3 months, so eventually if it was bad side effects, they'd wear off. Bad news is: could I go 3 months without talking (i.e. it could make the speaking worse and my speech would become more unintelligible.)\\nIt took me awhile to wrap my head around the whole idea of the pump...but this side of it, I was so glad I didn't listen to my own misgivings. So maybe this will be the same.\\nI'd love to hear from somebody who's had botox in that region and the side effects caused, specifically swallowing and speaking.\", 'I have never used it for my jaw but I do use it for muscle spasms in my neck, head and upper back.

Now I only need them about twice a year. The Botox has been a miracle drug for me. I was able to stop taking zanaflex, I was able to lower my dose of Nerotonin from 1800 mg a day to 600 mg a day and also lower my Skelaxin dose.\\nI hope it works as well for you as it did for me.', \"Originally posted by Barrister16 View Post\\nI have never used it for my jaw but I do use it for muscle spasms in my neck, head and upper back.

Knowing you've had Botox in you neck and head with none of the side effects makes me feel much better about Botox shots. All the warnings about swallowing, etc were rather daunting. Your post really helped me have a more balanced view of the injections.\", \"Tongue problems here too\\nHello!\\nI have had stiffness in my tongue for ten years. However, the main culprit is most probably an operation I had done to my tongue right before. The injured muscle never recovered from the operation in the sense that I feel the area getting stiffer on its own. The stiff feeling comes and goes, on a daily basis usually. Years later, it has become worse. It has spread into the base of my tongue which nowadays feels like getting stiff, too. I tend to describe the feeling like what a man probably feels when he gets an erection, only that it's the tongue\\nI was diagnosed with ms soon after the operation. I think I had ms already before, but the operation and everything related to it was such a stress to my physical and mental health, that it triggered the ms to rear its head and I got the diagnosis.\\nDoctors think that the spastic feelings I have in my tongue can be both operation related and ms related or that it's impossible to know which one to blame or both.\\nI'm so happy to hear of someone else with this weird problem.\", \"re: Botox\\nHello,\\nI have suffered with jaw/mouth pain since April 2011, approx. a month after I was diagnosed with MS it started. It took my neuro forever (it seemed like) to finally diagnose me correctly. She was treating me for Trigeminal Neuralgia when I actually had Oro-facial Dystonia. The treatments are very different.\\nAnyway, long story short, I get Botox injections into my jaw (both sides) and scalp (covers the masseter muscles) every 90 days and have for years. It was life changing!!!\\nIt was so bad that chewing food, chewing gum, laughing, or talking too much exacerbated the problem. Soft foods became a routine; my teeth hurt, my jaw hurt, which made my head hurt...until she realized I needed Botox to fix the problem.\\nAs long as I stay on my 90 day cycle I'm good to go and I have a much better quality of life.\\nGood luck.\", 'Hi Grade1 and Mlissa,\\nI just saw this thread was \"resurrected\" and found your stories very interesting.\\nGrade1, mine feels stiff too, and it won\\'t move. If they say stick out your tongue and say\\n\"Ah\"....I can\\'t stick out my tongue, in fact the Ah sound seems to cause it to retreat more down my throat...but this is all one sided issues.\\nUpdate to the problem: I was sent to the dystonia, and botox neuro for his opinion. After examining me, he said there was really no fix because my tongue has atrophied on that side, and the muscles are too weak to make it move \"right.\" That whole side of my face is not cooperative at all My lip droops and the face itself doesn\\'t move (with the exception of my forehead...it moves, but evidently that\\'s a different nerve that innervates the forehead. In fact, I believe the way they differentiate Bell\\'s Palsy is if the forehead moves or not.)\\nIf it wasn\\'t for the strange sensations, and down right pain that I get when I overdo it (i.e. talk too much, eat something that requires a lot of chewing, or try to eat a thick sandwich or corn on the cob, for that matter)...I wouldn\\'t be concerned about the cosmetic aspect...but it\\'s the pain and altered sensations that drive me batty. They did up my nortriptylene and that did help some. I also take oral baclofen (I have a baclofen pump for lower body spasticity) and a small dose of Klonopin for the face/tongue issues. I really didn\\'t think it helped much, but the other day I forgot and skipped a dose. I was trying to figure out why I was having so many problems with the area, and then realized I missed a dose...so the anti-spasticity, and muscle relaxer do help.\\nMlissa, so glad you\\'ve had such great success with the botox. That\\'s what I was hoping I could get, but the botox neuro said it probably wouldn\\'t help and where he\\'d need to inject was the one place he had never botoxed in his career. He indicated the place that would need to be treated with botox would compromise my swallowing.\\nBut I\\'m thrilled to hear it has worked for you. There\\'s a youtube video on oromandibular dystonia, and the man (he doesn\\'t have MS...just the dystonia) who did the video had great success with using a mouthpiece (looks likes a retainer) and eventually botox. It\\'s a really interesting video...you can use oromandibular dystonia in the youtube search engine and come up with his story.\\nThanks to both of you for sharing your experiences.']\n"
