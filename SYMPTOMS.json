    "Post" : "hi everyone. It's been awhile since I've been on this site but I was thinking about you and hoping everyone was good. I just need some help with my spasticity. My legs won't stop spasming during the day and during the night. It's like they're going constantly. My neurologist has prescribed Baclofen and he increased the dosage so that I am on the maximum. He also prescribed phenobarbital at night when I go to bed. I don't know what else to do it's even to the point where when I get up on my standing device like yesterday my leg spasms and my foot kicked off the bottom stand and I fell all the way down to the floor and my husband who is an injured Vet had to pick me up and that was very very painful for him. So if anyone has any suggestions on what I should do or what different medication I can take that would be very very helpfu. Thank you!",

Has your neuro considered that option?\nThere is a separate forum for spasticity. There may be a few threads of interest to you while you wait for responses to your question.\nhttp://www.msworld.org/forum/forumdi...132-Spasticity\nHope you are able to find something that works.",

    "Post" : "So sorry, Angela! You definitely sound like a candidate for a baclofen pump (also known as Intrathecal Baclofen Therapy, or ITB).\nThere are several people here who have one, including me. It has been a real blessing for me. I was on the maximum dose of oral Baclofen, Tizanidine, and Valium and still wasn't getting the relief I needed. I was then fortunate to find a new neurologist, a MS Specialist, who referred me to a spasticity specialist for further evaluation.\nThe medication is delivered directly to the intrathecal area of the spine, and a much lower dose is needed for relief.\nA trial is scheduled first to see if you are a candidate for one. Medication will be injected into your intrathecal space, and they will watch to see how you respond to it. Sometimes it takes more than one trial to determine if your are a candidate.\nSurgery to implant the pump and catheter which delivers the medication to your spine is scheduled if you respond to the trial.\nAnother option for some people is Botox, but it really sounds like you would be a candidate for the pump. Here is some more information for you:\nhttps://www.medtronic.com/us-en/pati...pasticity.html\nBest of luck to you, and please ask us any questions you have!",

My muscles stiffen so much that I can barely move when I get too cold.\nI'm also heat intolerant, which causes extreme weakness, among other symptoms.\nI have a pretty small window (of decent temperature) in which my impaired nerve signals function at their best.\nTake Care",

KoKo and I had a recent discussion in the exercise forum regarding heat.\nYou chose the proper word when you said \"Any warmer, I... get weaker...\"\nI never had a problem with any kind of heat. Still don't really, but did notice a difference as far as muscle response after 15 minutes in a jacuzzi following pool exercise.\nWeaker. Muscles that were as responsive as mine can get after a workout (and a short rest), were definitely weaker, less reactive. The heat has to be the root cause.\nI can lean toward sleepy, but stupid... it may be harder to tell any difference ;-)",

Steroids do two things in the body; they reduce inflammation and reduce the activity of the immune system. So you could be benefiting from one or both of the actions.\nA functional medicine doctor would put you on an anti-inflammatory diet intended to both reduce your inflammation, and calm your immune system. They would talk to you about \"gut health\" put you on pre/pro-biotics, cut out all processed foods, sugar, dairy, etc. You can read Mamabug's functional medicine experience here: https://www.msworld.org/forum/showth...ree-sugar-free\nHere's a link that partially discusses pulse steroids:\nhttp://www.nationalmssociety.org/Nat...p_Steroids.pdf\nI sure hope you found something that can improve your long-term quality of life.\nI wish you well...",

If the change feels like too much all at once, cutting out high salt, high sugar, and high fat (fried) foods and drinking lots of water during a steroid course is something to seriously consider.

It started occasionally when I was up in my wheelchair too long and would go down after laying in bed. However, a month after the intermittent episodes, my legs swelled up so bad that the skin was very tight in my feet, ankles and lower legs. My legs were hurting. Even elevating my legs wasn't helping. I cut back using salt, stopped drinking diet soda and starting really pushing water. My neuro was concerned and ordered Lymphodemia treatments. I go twice a week. The therapist does message to stimulate the Lymph system to work more efficiently and afterward the legs are wrapped tightly with ace bandages to encourage drainage through the kidneys. I have been going for 3 weeks now and have lost 3 Liters of fluid from both legs. I am very impressed! The only thing new for me is I switched to Ocrevus infusions last fall for my MS, so I will ask my doctor if there is any relation to that.\nHowever, start with your wife's primary physician. Write down questions for the doctor. Has your wife started new medication recently? Does she see a heart specialist? Are there any other symptoms? I'm sure her doctor will direct you both in a way that is best for her.\nGood Luck to both of You!",

Please do look at lifestyle interventions- overcomingmultiplesclerosis with Dr. Jelinek has great suggestions.

Even beyond the MS struggles, they don´t seem to get the psychological part that is required to deal with the diagnosis, its uncertainties and it´s possibilities for the future.

    "Post" : "Hello!\nHello DonnaH - and welcome! I'm sure you'll find msworld a great help - I know I sure do!\nI just got back from seeing my new neuro who says PPMS but we need the results from the MRI and/or a LP before an official diagnosis. I just thought I'd share my story real quick to give you more sides. As others have already said, everyone is different and please just take each day as it comes instead of living in a future that probably isn't true anyway.\nI started having noticeable issues about 12 years ago. I'm terrible with timing, so that's a guess. My first issue was my right leg. I was very active, and would start out each day with a vigorous 4 mile walk. At the time, my youngest was about 9 years old and I was a single mom. I would bring a different child with me each morning and it was such a nice time for us But I noticed my right leg and foot was getting unusually tired right at the start of our walk. I shrugged it off and thought maybe I just needed new shoes. I kept switching shoes and nothing seemed to help, but still I shrugged it off.\nThat went on for a few years, and then my whole body just seemed to be breaking down. I was still very active and had a full daily schedule, but found myself not able to keep up, having to rest, take naps, etc. My balance was getting worse and I started falling every so often. Other things began to happen as well. Looking back now it's easy for me to see the problem: I was trying to live like nothing was wrong and that was causing all sorts of stress on the underlying issue and my body was freaking out and protesting.\nI continued to get worse and eventually (finally) saw a doctor. He said several things, took several tests, and then suggested an MRI to check for things like MS. I had no clue what MS was, so I didn't even really hear him. I did not care much for that doctor, so I found another GP and he's been my GP ever since. At my first appointment, he agreed with the first doctor: MS. I also talked to a friend who was a doctor in another country. MS.\nI finally saw a neurologist, but because my brain MRIs were clear, nothing much was done. A few other tests and such, but I felt like I was wasting my time. Since doctors made me anxious and my neuro was 3 hours away and I was not getting anywhere, I quit going for 2 or 3 years. I went back again, and then had another break, and so on.\nFast forward to our current time (for reference, I am 42 years old).\nIn the past 8 or so years I've progressed from being seemingly healthy and active, thin and in shape, to needing a cane, walker, wheelchair, or electric buggy (depending on the activity). My activities and responsibilities have been DRASTICALLY cut down by my loved ones and now all I have to do is sit around ... anything else I manage to get done is considered a bonus. Recently I have begun gaining weight, which is so hard for me to cope with. Not being active is finally taking a toll on that side of things. I do my best to eat healthy (I am very health-conscious when it comes to food!), so I think the only way to help myself with weight now is to be careful with portion size and snacking.\nI have found ways to save energy. I really, really, really want to stay as active and productive as possible, so I just set a timer for 15 to 20 minutes, work on a task at a comfortable pace, and when the timer goes off I sit down and rest as long as I feel I need to. Sometimes I'm able to get back up and do another 15 minutes of 'work' after about a half hour of rest, but usually I need to rest for at least an hour before trying to do something else.\nIt may not sound like much, but in doing things this way I am actually able to get a lot done. In the past I would push myself and then crash for several days. That means getting a lot LESS done.\nReducing stress as much as possible is so very important. Also, I believe a regular bedtime routine and daily nap is crucial.\nOther ways of adapting: I sit down as much as possible when doing tasks. Like dishes for example. I never thought I'd be sitting down to do dishes, but it sure spares my legs! I ask for help. I lower my standards and expectations of myself. I have grab bars and stools in various trouble areas of my home.\nI try to stretch every day.\nBecause of my right side weakness and some confusion, I am not able to drive much. I usually feel safe and able to drive to church and back, but that's it [mostly country roads and about 10 minutes away]. I have a friend that takes me to all of my doctor appointments and does some of my shopping. My daughter helps me out with the rest of the shopping and such.\nI've learned that life is not over!! While we may not be able to do all of the things we used to do, we can still find joy! I find joy in gardening, watching birds, and a few other things. My family does all of the hard work in the garden and I just try to go there each morning, set my stool down, and pick weeds for about 15 minutes each day. This is my happy place. Fresh air, birds singing, breeze blowing, sun shining. I get out there as early as possible to avoid the heat and the mosquitos.\nKeeping a healthy attitude is so vital to your well being. And as others have also said, be careful about anxiety and such. I had not idea that anxiety would be a problem for me, but I find myself getting more anxious as the years go by. This is just not me (well, it is now!!! but it never was in the past). I can tell my loved ones \"I'm done\" and they all know what that means. This has been a huge help. Only those who are closest to me have seen me at my worst, so when someone outside of my close circle happens to see me at my worst it's kind of scary for them to witness. \"My worst\" happens when I've done too much.\nI found this thread by searching for \"ocrevus\" - my neuro wants me to take it as soon as I am diagnosed and I am just not interested. I share the same concerns you do.\nI hope my ramblings have helped in some way.",

    "Post" : "Hi everyone. I'm here as the husband of a newly diagnosed MS sufferer.\nI'm learning as I go as we both are, but there are some things that doctors won't tell you or simply won't accept responsibility for so I have to ask people for anecdotal evidence, and hopefully you guys can be a source for me.\nI could write a novel, but I'll get to the point. My wife was given two days of 1000 mg Solu-Medrol IV in the hospital and then 1250 oral at home to help with calming down the lesion she had which started this off.\nI know all docs have different protocols, but she was not titrated down after the 3 day dose with anything.\nShe was actually feeling a lot better BEFORE her diagnostic spinal tap and eventual steroid regimen in the hospital and now she has the sensation that her head is huge and is generally feeling like crap.\nCan any of you out there share a similar experience with a high-dose steroid regimen for MS? Other folks I've asked have said yes,the steroids made them feel awful and that a couple of weeks was needed to get back to normal. She is despondent and I need to help her any way I can.

She is despondent and I need to help her any way I can. Thank you.\nHello Swataz and welcome! Thank you for coming to us for the sake of your wife. I was given 5 days of Solu-Medrol IV almost 20 years ago for a nasty flare of optic neuritis. I was not given a taper down schedule. After the 5th day I was feeling horrible! I thought I was having a heart attack, I was filled with anxiety, was crying all the time and I couldn't sleep.\nIn short, I found out I was having major panic attacks after seeing my pcp who prescribed valium to ease things up and calm me down. It took a day to kick in but helped. However, my vision did not return to near normal for about 6 weeks afterwards and is still somewhat compromised. This is my story - others have different experiences.\nI have opted to never have another IV treatment after this first time. I never wanted to go through that experience ever again. Nowadays, I hear that a taper down schedule is mostly used. I am sorry your wife is having a hard time and I can certainly empathize with her. It does take time to get back to normal.\nYou might want to talk with her neuro or primary care doctor and let them know what's going on. In the meantime, be gentle with her - her body is going through a lot of stress. My husband did all the cooking, cleaning and laundry while I recuperated - lucky me!\nWhen she is feeling better, let her know we'd love to have her check in with us.\nBoth of you take care and send her good thoughts from MSWorld",

    "Post" : "Hi Swataz, it's so great of you to reach out on behalf of your wife, she must be really special. Regarding the IV, I am unfamiliar with the dosage your wife is on. If the IV was 1,000 mg per infusion the 1,250 is even more.\nI've had the IV quite a few times, the last one was approx 2007 so things may have changed since then. My dosage was 1,000 mg IV for 5 days then an oral dose to taper off the med starting at around 5 pills of 80 mg and decreasing the dose until I'm down to 1 mg for a few days. I was told that 1,000 mg is a dangerously high dose to just stop so the oral taper was needed.\nRegardless, the entire IV/oral experience is nothing short of horrible. During the IV part, I can't sleep, have endless energy, anger easy (I'm normally such a mellow lady) and eat my face off. After the IV comes out I just crash for a few days, no high dose med to keep me awake plus all the false energy I wasted on the IV comes back to haunt me. Also I was warned to stay away from people that are sick with the flu, cold, etc. The high dose is meant to shut down your immune system (so it stops attacking and keep reducing inflammation). It just makes it very easy to catch something.\nI know it's hard to believe that when she feels this horrid things are improving but it may take a wee while for her to get through the side effects of the med. I used to say that the entire IV/oral treatment made me feel worse than my MS did but things really did improve. Only once out of approx 8 treatments did my affected body part not respond favourably, my left eye only sees light and shadows but it couldn't even see that much before the treatment.\nI wish the 2 of you well with this, please don't be shy here, there's so much great advice from all angles.\nJen",

    "Post" : "Hi, I had four days of solu-medrol - the dosage was very high, followed by an oral taper. Sorry I don't have the exact amounts. I had it for optic neuritis where I completely lost the vision in one eye (the infusion helped).\nI did not have a horrible experience. However, I read up about how to possibly avoid bad side effects. I simply reduced sodium and sugar intake to nearly zero, unless it was natural in what I was eating. I also kept pretty low fat. I hydrated like I had the flu, and I rested as much as possible.\nThe first day of steroids made me feel like a million bucks, but I guess that's because I was relapsing and they helped with inflammation and some stabbing neuritis pain in my eye also was relieved pretty quickly. The taper was ok - the hardest part was modifying my diet because I had read that salty food can make you feel terrible when you're on steroids, but that the urge to snack salty foods is indeed powerful.\nWishing you and your wife the best.",

And compared to many others dealing with ms i consider myself to be very fortunate in that my level of disability isn't very severe especially considering i have had ms for over 30 yrs now.\nBut i have been researching a lot more in the last few yrs and have learned a lot that i wasn't previously aware of. As well researchers have learned a lot of new info as well.\nFor example it is no longer a reliable supposition to say - no new lesions, stable.\nBecause although the lesion load used to be the principle way to gauge progression and disability , it is now known that 'white matter damage' isn't the only damage being done.\nIn the back ground 'grey matter damage\" is occurring and this is now believed to contribute more to overall disability than lesions by some.\nThis 'grey matter damage' can cause brain and nerve atrophy and cause the patient to progress despite no visible increase in lesion load.\nIf Margery has had ms for 17 yrs plus it is possible that she may be transitioning to spms as well so you may like to discuss this with doc.\nHope this helps,\nAll the best,\nCaroline.",

    "Post" : "Hi Stephen:\nOriginally posted by stephenjohnpric View Post\nShe was diagnosed with MS some seventeen years ago ... Little or no problems apart from slight limp since.\nIf your wife has had little to no problems in 17 years, then I'm guessing that she hasn't had a lot of MRIs in that time. While it's possible that your wife has had only one lesion in her brain in all this time, it's also possible that there have been other lesions at other times, but that one has been the only one present at the time of her MRIs so is the only one that was ever captured in an image.\nIt's well known that lesions, particularly small ones, can come and go on their own over time. If a person doesn't have MRIs very often, it's possible that small lesions have come and gone over time and were just never present at the time an MRI was done. There's a great online article available that contains time-lapse videos showing how one man's brain lesions waxed and waned over MRIs taken a month apart over the course of a year. Any two of those images taken months apart could have looked essentially the same, leading to the false impression that nothing significant had happened in between them. If the link works properly, you can see it here: http://www.msdiscovery.org/news/news...more-meets-eye.\nOriginally posted by stephenjohnpric View Post\nconsultant said this wasvery unusual\nYes, it is very unusual for a person with MS to have only one lesion over a large span of years, but 1) it can happen due to the randomness of MS and the great variability that exists in presentation, and 2) there remains the unknown possibility that there may have been other lesions that have come and gone and never caused any significant symptoms that were never caught on MRI.\nOriginally posted by stephenjohnpric View Post\nconsultant ... is reasonably confident that spasms will not spread any further\nThat's a reasonable assumption based on the one longstanding lesion. If no other significant lesions have shown up over 17 years, there may not be any significant lesions in the future that will cause spasticity. That's not a guarantee, but it's a reasonable assumption to make based on 17 years of history.\nIt's also reasonable to assume that that one lesion is acting as lesions do over time and causing more symptoms as the nerves affected by the lesion deteriorate. The continuing decline of the nerve cells can cause new symptoms even though the lesion looks the same on MRI.\nSo that part of your wife's history is not unusual -- normal and expected progression of MS (even only one lesion!) over time leading to new symptoms. Even with treatment medications available over the last 15 years, some people with MS still transition to the secondary progressive stage at about 15 years. It sounds like that's what's happening in your wife's case.\nAlso, spasticity is very common in people with MS. So your wife's case isn't at all unusual in that respect. It doesn't really matter how many lesions are causing the spasticity or where they are. The treatment options are the same -- medications that include a nerve \"quieter,\" a muscle relaxer, or a combination of both. Other things like physical therapy, judiciously applied heat, or massage can help prevent or relieve some people's spasticity. But spasms that occur at night and affect sleep seem to respond best to the regular and continuous taking of medication so that a steady-state level (as much as possible) can be achieved that will carry the prevention or reduction of spasticity through the night.\nI had one very large spinal cord lesion 15 years ago that has resolved to the point that it's not visible on my MRIs anymore, but the leg spasms -- particularly at night -- have remained. I take baclofen regularly every night to prevent the terrible, painful leg spasms that used to wake me up, sometimes several times a night.\nYour wife's leg spasticity and pain aren't uncommon, and the treatment meds are pretty much the same for everyone. I hope she's able to be successful with one of them and get some relief.",

I’m wary of having chemicals injected often.\nContrast does not cause Multiple Sclerosis.\nIt is important to have blood work to check Kidney function before having contrast. Contrast is filtered out of the body through the Kidneys/urinary tract.\nWhen having a MRIs with contrast be sure to drink plenty of water before the MRIs, not too much for obvious reasons. After the MRIs are done drink more water as this will flush the contrast out after 1 or 2 times of urinating.\nMultiple Sclerosis literally means many scars. The lesions MS causes is scaring due to demyelination (stripping away Myelin which is the protective coating for our nerves). MRIs are ever changing in MS, there can be more or less lesions and some that are not detectable. If a person has MS there will always be lesions, it's not possible to never have MS type lesions and have this disease, it's just not.\nI was diagnosed a very long time ago. The MRI was fairly new and we had 2 MRI machines in the entire State. My MRIs were clear. My Neurological evaluation, positive Lumbar Puncture, and symptoms gave the clinical picture for MS and I received my diagnosis. I now have lesions and have for many years.

    "Post" : "MS &amp; Stroke Spasticity\nI Tried Baclofin & Zanaflex many times over the years. I hallucinate and go through Psychotic episodes. After two heart attacks my spasticity got unbearable. Then after having hip replacement needed due my Steroid treatments I found that Percocet eased my spasticity so I could sleep at night. A Paranoid Neurologist had me try Gabapentin. This helped but only partially worked. So I now after 15 years use a still low dose of OxyContin and 1800 mg of Gabapentin. Now what no one believes is that as per side effects of these two drugs it's the Gabapentin which gets me close to a Maryjane High. This sucks as being high all the time destroys any relief it might offer. The OxyContin only makes me dizzy and sleepy. With great difficulty I found a Neurologist who also is a Pain management Specialist. As my condition is long term Chronic and because of my low dose long term non-addictive use of OxyContin this Doctor and the DEA has no problem with my treatment. Of course I have to plan to pee in a cup after an hour drive by my wife. I'm sure many of you know how stressful this is. Oh this Pain management doctor is almost the only one Between NYC & Albany. I know no one will Admit such use due to fear of being cut off from effective treatments but I still try to find a discussion. jude",

    "Post" : "This topic always gets me so upset because I've been battling chronic pain for over five years without any sustained relief. The new opioid medication regulations that began in October of this year are in my opinion, wrong-headed and counterproductive. They punish chronic pain sufferers like us, who have done nothing wrong, unless you're one of those people that think pain is a character-builder, or God's plan for you.\nMoreover, I predict that it will do little to reduce drug overdoses for people who abuse Rx drugs, and here's an example of why I saw that: my nephew, who has a long history of abusing drugs like OxyContin, overdosed on heroin this past Tuesday. Fortunately a first responder administered Narcan, which revived him and probably saved his life. For now.\nI think it's likely that he wouldn't have turned to heroin if controlled dose Rx drugs had been available to him. Here is an in-depth article that discusses this issue. (From the Atlantic under Features if my link doesn't make the cut): http://www.theatlantic.com/features/...idemic/382020/\nThe money quote:\nThe crackdown on doctors might have stanched the flow of prescription pills, but it did so with a deadly externality: West Virginians have turned to heroin—a cheaper and, frequently, more accessible high. Law enforcement officials here told me that heroin is now their “number-one problem.”\nMy nephew has been through numerous drug rehab programs over the years, and yet here we are again. There's really no reason to believe at this point that another stint of \"treatment\" with a devastating price tag is going to change his behavior. But in lieu of any other options, we will again cough up the $$$ to the \"recovery\" industry that has a failure rate so abysmal that if it were a new drug, would never even be considered for Phase I. But one thing that will be different for this round is that the next time he relapses, there's a really good chance that he will choose a street drug that will kill him.\nMeanwhile, those of us who suffer not just day by day, but hour by hour, will go untreated. I see no good news for anyone here.",

My decision to stop opioids was the result of my first appointment with the Pain Specialist, but that experience is a bit OT to this thread.\nI've since then read several interesting articles regarding the new rx'ing rules implemented by DEA, the related cost and inconvenience to some of the most seriously ill patients.\nThe additional cost of monthly office visits for rx refills is a primary concern, plus the demands of another OV more frequent than my MS, MRIs, etc. Add to the increased cost is the fact that a pain 'specialist' charges more per office visit. Also the cost of monthly urine testing.\nConsider the impact to the DEA as legalization of MJ becomes more wide spread. I think the DEA's new business model is based on keeping themselves 'relevent', and to minimize the impact of job losses and budget cuts.\nThen there's the GP who wants to increase earnings by becoming certified in Pain Management, many who own their own labs for monthly urinalysis.\nThe new DEA regs are just so counterintuitive considering the burden on an already streatched health care delivery system and counter to reducing the cost on the 'system' and the cost burden on patients.\nThere must be a better solution to the Pain Med abuse problem, but I just don't think the new regs are the correct answer to this problem.",

More pain med prescriptions were written, and drugs being what they are, more people used, then abused them. At least with prescription drugs, the FDA sees to it that you get exactly what it says on the label.\nNow, as the OP and Atlantic point out, new stiffer regulations (for monthly office visits and drug tests) are brought onboard to fix the problems created by the old regulations to \"fix\" pain, and they are causing people to go back to heroin off the street. Predictably this causes more illegal drug trafficking and drug overdose deaths.\nThose who pay the price are those who have a legitimate need for medication to treat their chronic pain. They are assumed to be criminals and drug abusers until \"proven\" otherwise - after jumping through all the hoops and expense of Pain Management Clinics, more visits and drug testing.\nI don't think pain is character-building, and I realize pain cannot be eliminated completely from the planet. But how about making it possible for patients with legitimate chronic pain to get enough relief to carry on with their minimal daily activities - caring for themselves, their homes, their families, maybe even holding a job.\nMS itself is bad enough, with no cure at present; at least let us get treatment for some of the symptoms.",

The first means that you will use just about anything because you crave the high or the feeling that the substance or behavior gives you. Dependence is needing to maintain a certain level to avoid withdrawal. It is accurate to say that Gabapentin, Lyrica, Cymbalta, and the whole host of other antidepressants and anti-seizures also cause dependence because you cannot stop taking them suddenly without adverse effects. Yet they hand those out like candy.\nAnd if we want to talk about overdoses, let's start talking about Tylenol, shall we?\nAs for expecting all the pain to be gone, I don't even know where to start. I would pay serious money to just have a level six day every now and then. Most people I know would have thrown in the towel ages ago if they had to cope with the kind of pain I do every day.

    "Post" : "This is the new prohibition. I never took drugs before my diagnosis. First, I got ON so I had a high dose of dilaudid ordered for me in the hospital. Then, my PCP was prescribing 10mg of Percocet per month +1 1/2mg of Xanax.\nI asked my doctor if she was worried about addiction. She kept assuring me that it was ok. Then I got a jaw infection that required two months of IV antibiotics in the hospital. I was prescribed 2mg of dilaudid every 3 hours. As the jaw healed, I was still asking for dilaudid. They asked me what hurt. I said my eye., maybe at that point I was experiencing rebound pain I still don't know.\nAfter I got out of the hospital, I was still taking the 10mg Percocet. First, once a day, then 2 times, then, every eight hours. I was dependent and I knew a tolerance was building but the terrible achy feeling of MS was something I just didn't want to feel.\nMy PCP didn't want to keep prescribing to me so she sent me to a pain management doctor.\nHis office was wonderful. It was in the a Cancer Center which was a beautiful building. I had a great experience with him and over the four years we seemed to building a good relationship based on trust.\nThen, I went to my October appointment at the Cancer Center and his office was GONE. They gave me his new address so,I hobbled over there in the heat. Finally made it there and they rushed me into a tiny office with a man sitting at the desk. My beloved pain doctor was angry and said, \"YOU ARE LATE!\" I had just lost 15 minutes going to the wrong office. He was talking really fast about now they had a new system. I would have to come every month and all prescriptions would be sent electronically.\nSo I went to my November appointment on time, hoping he would be in a better mood. He said, well I'm going to have to test you now. That was the first time he had ever tested me without a month's advance notice. I wasn't worried because I take my medication the way I am supposed to.\nWell, in December I go in for my appointment. I came a half hour early so I wouldn't be late and he kept me waiting an hour after the appointment time. He walks in with his laptop, doesn't say hello, looks at the results of my test and says, are you taking any barbiturates? I said, \" I was taking Donatol but they don't make it anymore.\" He said, \"well your barbiturate level,was 5000. The maximum it should be is 50. Would you like to take the test again to see if it's,out of your system? I said, no thank you.\nWhen I left the office I was scared. I know for sure I did not have barbiturates in my system that day. What if he tests me again and it shows up something illegal and I get arrested? He obviously has a bogus lab. Anything could happen. I talked to the office manager who has been very approachable lately. She told me others patients have come to her upset about the lab results. She says she wants to change labs. But for. me the doctor patient relationship has been severely damaged.\nI don't know what to do. If I go off the pain meds, I will have long term withdrawal effects and be in pain.\nI get so annoyed when they say, \" the new war on drugs ins being waged in the doctors office.\" They should let doctors practice medicine.\nDoes anyone have any suggestion on how to handle this? If I stomp out saying I'm getting a new pain doctor, that would be drug addict behavior. If I stay I could be getting into who,knows what. My pain doctor is a very good person. He wants to help people and, at the same time, he is not a pill mill. Why does the DEA make such a mess? I think they are destroying more lives than they are saving.",

    "Post" : "Wow, this is the dilemma that I am up against now. I've been using Norco for pain in my arm, at night, for the last 3-4 years. I always make the medication last longer than the Rx allows so they know I am not taking too many or selling them or ?\nSo now I have to see my GP, who as my lead Doc manages the pain meds, which I never understood as they tested everything and concluded I was having pain as a result of MS. He already sent an email saying I needed to be seen at least twice per year and take urine tests. He didn't say what all they are testing for but I assume most everything?\nI really don't want to subject myself to regular trips to the hospital as I am trying to work a few more years while I'm still able. I guess I'll be trying to get by with just the mega-gabapentin routine and see if that helps?\nGrrrrrrr.............Frustrating..........",

    "Post" : "Palmtree, I was trying to avoid getting into my personal experience with my pain med docs, but after reading a couple of things in your post that sound erriely similar to my own experiences, here goes.\nI was on Vicodine for 10yrs, rx by my MS doc for the first 5yrs, then a PM doc when I relocated to the P.N.West. The PM doc and I had a cordial doc/patient relationship. His knowledge of MS pretty limited, but he always wrote my refills 3 refills, one rx on three seperate scrips to accomodate my MS.\nThe nursing staff on the other hand play the 'bad cop' while the PM doc played the role of 'good cop'. I found the good cop/bad cop totally alien to anything I'd ever experienced, it totally bewildered me. But, I'd never had a urinalysis during my 4yrs as a patient there, because I complied with the terms of the PM treatment contract.\nMy PM doc also moved to a new location. I have visual spatial deficites, I get lost easy even in familiar places, stores, etc. The first couple of appointments after the docs moved, I would get horribly lost, paniced, but I was determined to at least show up for my appointment even if only out of courtesy.\nI explained to the receptionist that I realized I was late, was extremely sorry, and understood if they had to reschedule my appointment. Explained that the relocation combined with the spatial skills problems, were cognitively incompatiable for me. (To say the nursing staff must have received their training in the state prison is putting it mildly.)\nEventually there was a mix up in the number of refills, and I left the office with 2 refills versus the usual 3 refills. When I called the office to request the 3rd refill, explaining the error made on the earlier rx, the refil was refused. I was given an appointment for later in the week.\nMy decades of insomnia was now complicated by the increased pain over the next few days. I always seemed to wait until early AM to take sleep meds, which naturally only make me hung over and sleep deprived the following day for my appointment.\nI was sleep deprived and hung over, just a mess when I showed up for the appointment to clear up the error made on my previous rx, 2 refills versus the usual 3 refills. I brought a copy of the original rx I request from the pharmacy to document the error.\nWhen I showed up for the appointment, there was a derigatory comment about my balance problems, lack of focus/blood shot eyes, and despite being properly dressed and groomed, I was obviously distressed from the sleep med hang over combined with being sleep deprived and the stress I anticipated during this office visit that was clearly developing into a showdown with a doc I previously had a very good relationship with.\nI was immediately escorted to the office building bathroom by a nurse, standing guard out side of the bathroom stall, for a urnine test. I wasn't allowed to have my purse with me!It was a humilating experience.\nI knew I wouldn't be returning to this doc, but I agreed to the urine test because I waned documentation in my file that my urine was clean per the terms of PM treatment contract.\nI went for my next neuro appointment about 2 months later, explained the 2 versus 3 refills misunderstanding at the PM clinic, and my neuro refilled the pain med rx.\nIt didn't take very long for my neuro's hospital plan to establish a PM clinic, which I was referred to. As usual, I was sleep deprived and experiencing mild balance problems.\nThe receptionist commented about my obvious state of poor balance, bloodshot eyes and impaired coordination. Explaining that I have MS with chronic insomnia, ineffective sleep med complications and balance problems made no impression what so ever. I was a marked woman already.\nThings deterioted quickly once I saw the PM doc during the initial visit. There were obvious cultural and english second language differences that contributed to a very awakard first and last appointment with the PM doc.\nThere was some PM doc grunting sounds, deep disapproving breaths and other non verbal negative judgments when she looked at my bottle of pain meds.\nAgain I agreed to the urine test in order for my records to reflect that I had nothing in my system other than 2 non narcotic meds rx'ed by my MS doc, knowing I wouldn't be returning to the PM clinic.\nI was not only offended by the PM Contract as 'medical care', I couldn't afford additional cost of monthly visits for another specialist and the cost of monthly labs.\nI couldn't rely on being able to comply with the terms of the PM Contract demands for monthly OVs. It's necessary for me to break up grooming and personal hygine preperations for my Neuro visists over 2 days because of fatigue, insomnia, etc., and I only see my neuro every 3 months, MRIs 3x a year.\nThe constant pain is very difficult to contend with day to day, in addition to the negative consequences on my physical and mental well being. I'm near the threshold for tolerating it much longer.",

    "Post" : "I forgot to mention that doc offices make their share of mistakes, errors, etc. I've experienced 2 very serious oversights by my MS doc's office.\nOne involved postponing my monthly TY infusion while I was evaluated for PML based on a new, serious mobility issue. I got a call from my Neuro that I had changes on MRIs, first in 8-10yrs, but no PML. No discussion about when I would resume infusions. I assumed it would be handled by the MS doc staff. After all I can't call the infusion center asking where's my TY when infusions were suspended by my doc.\nThat call never came, so I called my neuro's office, left a voice message about resuming my Ty infusion. I got a voice mail from a nurse asking what rx refill did I need.\nA few more days of voice mail/phone tag, and almost 60 days since my last Ty infusion with the danger of a Rebound exacerbation looming. I finally got the Ty appointment. That was not the only potentially huge 'office admin' problem I experienced over the years. But I'm not nit-picky, I realize office staff changes, short staffed due to illness, things happen even in my usually very well run MS docs office.\nAll that to say that doc offices make errors all the time, including MS docs and PM docs.\nSo when I look at the PM Clinic Patient Compliance Contract necessary to continued pain treatment, it's strikes me as more than a bit ironic. Even hipacratic/sp?, to put the patient to such high compliance standards, with the patient always under threat, even when an office error is responsible, or the standards in the contract are inconpitable, unrealistic for some patients.\nThe patient is the offender under suspition, regardless of the circumstances. That relization led me to the decision that despite daily pain, deteriotating physical and mental health as a result, it was not in my best interest to continue treatment at this time.",

My pain is due to facial and tongue spasm.\nWell I've complied with the once a month appt. and found the appts. okay because I then use it to \"catch up\" with other issues I need to discuss with him (since it's my GP it really has come in quite handy.)\nFor instance, I had pneumonia and after I finished my antibiotics (I was diagnosed at the ER) I was supposed to have an appt with the GP. Of course he didn't have any appts for weeks, but I had my \"standing\" drug Rx appt. so I was in good shape because that also became my pneumonia follow up appt.\nHowever, I was struck with the ridiculousness (is that a word?) last appt at GP. It was late on a Friday, and for some reason he wasn't there so I saw the NP. Of course the NP couldn't give me the RX for the pain med, it had to be signed by the GP...so I had to go back the next week to pick up the RX. Fortunately, I wasn't completely out of the med, but if I had been, I would have had to go three days without it (I was there on a Friday afternoon and the office doesn't open till 9 on Monday...so that would have been a painful weekend.\nAnother new thing...when my husband drops my RX off at the pharmacy, he has to have my ID...just to drop it off. I can understand them requiring my driver's license when he picks it up for me, but to need an ID just to drop off a RX is a little over the top in my book.\nI've never been asked to do a urine test though...I find that hard to believe that a person with a chronic illness gets treated like a drug abuser...it's not bad enough we have pain, we have to jump through hoops to get a Rx.\nOf course I should have seen this coming...when it became harder to get a $5 box of Sudafed than it was to pick up my $3000 box of Betaseron, I should have surmised things were going downhill",

    "Post" : "Wow, looks like a lot of us have common experiences with pain management! It kind of makes you wonder why these doctors would even want to go into this specialty when they seem to have so much contempt for their patients. I know that sounds harsh, but really, these stories are chilling. I have some of my own, and not dissimilar to many of yours.\nThere’s just so much to comment upon and respond to here, and I really appreciate everyone’s sharing on this topic.\nHere’s something palmtree said that struck a nerve with me:\nIf I stomp out saying I'm getting a new pain doctor, that would be drug addict behavior.\nYes, we put so much effort into avoiding the “drug-seeking” label. Sadly, we can maintain an irreproachable record for years, and then have one little, innocent slipup (I had one of these recently), and you are literally in a world of hurt. The rules are arbitrary and contradictory:\nExhaust your supply, and you’re depending on them too much. Don’t take them all, and you’re hoarding so you can take more all at once to get high.\nTell them your pain is an 8, and you’re not hurting enough to need meds. Tell them it’s a 10, and you’re exaggerating.\nComport yourself in a normal, rational manner, and you must not be in that much pain. Come off as agitated or depressed, and you need group therapy—no pain meds for you.\nAnd as someone up-thread said, things can be written into your record easily and without your knowledge. All it takes is one self-righteous, vindictive, or sadistic doctor, nurse, or PA who is having a bad day and you’re done. No chance for appeal or redemption. God help you if they cut you off when you’ve built up a dependency—it’s off to a detox unit with you.\nI don’t know about you, but I am so sick of living under this medical terrorism. I am so tired of being under constant suspicion and assumed to be incapable of making my own decisions. I have had it with being treated like I’m weak and self-indulgent because I just want the Pain. To. Stop.\nI am so very sorry for all of us, and am out of ideas and out of hope.",

(thread here: http://www.msworld.org/forum/showthr...rogressive-MS)\nSo of course I've been reading whatever I can find about it, and look at this:\n\"Ibudilast crosses the blood–brain barrier and suppresses glial cell activation. This activity has been shown to make ibudilast useful in the treatment of neuropathic pain and it not only enhances analgesia produced by opioid drugs, but also reduces the development of tolerance.\"\nNot only that, but another trial of Ibudilast is seeking to address opioid abuse, and says this:\n\"</not>Recent preclinical studies demonstrate that while ibudilast increases the analgesic effects of opioids, it decreases the rewarding effects of such drugs. It has also been shown that ibudilast suppresses morphine-induced release of dopamine, a primary neurotransmitter involved in the rewarding and reinforcing effects of abused drugs.\"\nIn other words, maybe we could have a pain med that in itself, relieves pain, and also helps opioids relieve pain better with a lower dose, while at the same time reduces the desire to abuse them. Doesn't this sound like a huge game-changer in pain management to you?\nSo where are all these ultra-concerned people who are so worried about pain medication abuse? Why aren't they jumping up and down, hollering about how we should research combining Ibudilast with opioids to see if we can't come up with an effective pain reliever that reduces drug abuse risk? Aren't they clamping down pain meds only because they really care about our well-being? Yeah, I never bought that, either.",

    "Post" : "All the horror stories make me feel very blessed.\nSince the regulations came into effect the only change for me is I have to go to the office to pick up a paper script once a month instead of them giving me 1 + 5 refills. With difficulties getting around that is annoying but nothing like what you folks are running into.\nI am sure it helps that I have been seeing the same PCP for 7 years and using the same pharmacist for even longer. I started out at 2 5mg vicodin a day and now after 7 years I am up to 4 5mg a day. Every time I needed to bump up the script I just told my doctor and he did it. I am not sure how that will go if I need another increase with the new regulations on the books. I have actually been weaning down to most days only 3 a day so I hope to never have to cross that bridge.\nAs far as the new regulations go there is NO mandatory drug test involved. The only effective change is that doctors can not write refills, and all scripts must be written out no phoning them in any longer. IF your doctor is requiring a drug test or any other hoops that is them not the DEA. Unfortunately for those who's doctors are requiring such things it will be very difficult to change doctors at this point as it would instantly make you appear to be a drug seeker. It is important to know your rights though just to give you confidence when dealing with your doctor. I know it is hard to stand up to a doctor and could ruin the relationship but honestly if your doctor is acting like that the relationship is already ruined.\nOne other thing I will add. I smoke pot both to help me sleep at night, to reduce muscle spasms and for the neuroprotective properties. I am not in a medical marijuana state but both my PCP and my Neurologist know that I smoke. That being the case a drug test would screw me royally so I am very cautions about what I agree to at the doctors office. Perhaps my legal gray area makes me more aware of the laws and my rights.",

    "Post" : "Originally posted by Jules A View Post\nI hope benzodiazepines are next on the list and overall believe it is time to start investigating other methods of pain control.\nAt thsi time there is an initiative to legalize medical marijuna in my state. I never used drugs, never advocated for their use recreationally or otherwise, so for me this a departure from my usual mo. Today I wrote a letter to a state House of Representative legislator (not mine) based on a quote from him in my newspaper. The following is the text from my letter:\nDear Representative Curtin:\nFirst, thank you for going into public service. I am sure your intentions to serve were not to become wealthy. Second, you are not my representative, and so probably feel no obligation to respond to this letter. Nevertheless, I would be thrilled to have a dialogue with you about your views with regard to legalization of marijuana.\nToday's Columbus Dispatch quoted you as saying, \"This issue is about trying to create a $1 billion industry for ten individuals and their friends.\" While I am not personally affiliated with anyone spearheading the proposed legislation, nor am I a member of NORML (I tend to laugh at people invested in trying to make it easier to use marijuana under the guise of compassion for people with medical issues), I am in favor of the legalization of medical marijuana. On that note, taken as said, your quote is incorrect.\nMarijuana needs to be studied to allow scientist and growers to produce standards for dosage the same as opiods or other synthetics in use currently. I am a patient with multiple sclerosis. Obviously I don't welcome my symptoms or the prospect of disease progression, but since there is no cure for my condition, and the pain management alternatives are known to be addictive and have a plethora of undesirable side effects, it only seems prudent to explore other avenues. That said, medical researchers know that to study one issue typically leads to the development of many offshoots. For example, I benefited from Tysabri, a medication that was developed to treat Crohn's disease.\nPlease don't shut this proposal down out of hand. Please consider diverting funds gained from its passage toward research to develop better medicines.\nRespectfully,\nBadAttitude",

The relationship(s) to prescription pain medication is that 1.) synthetic fentanyl is being used as an extra addicting agent in heroin. As fentanyl is a prescribed medication all pain medications suffer\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/am...idemic-n814956\nIf you read the story you will actually see where the CDC has done a 3 State study and found that over half of these deaths have synthetic heroin in them and more than that have elicit drugs. So this means that heroin and other illegal drug overdoses are being counted as opiod deaths and thus an epidemic. 2.) Most users of heroin have started with prescription pain meds and were either not getting enough (government regulations) or being cut off and this is what they felt that they needed to do to manage their pain.",

I like the way you expanded your answer to include other medication alternatives -- not just supplements, as I asked about, but also therapy, mindfulness, light therapy, stretching, etc. Those, actually, are more \"intentional\" than just popping a supplement in my mouth is. Good suggestions.\nFor me, I guess one of my helpful additions to my life is volunteering. Although it's somewhat \"cliche\", I feel like I often \"get more than I give\". Another one, although not nearly as enjoyable for me (because I've never liked exercise), is going to Curves once or twice a week. I should go more frequently, but, at least I'm doing something. These are not exactly alternatives to a medication, but, perhaps a preventative to depression, MS progression that comes with inactivity, etc.\nI've been checking back on this thread, looking for additional responses for others, if anyone has them.",

I'm sorry, I know how painful and debilitating that spasticity can be. I was considering Botox, but eventually decided on a Baclofen pump. I'll tell you what little I do know about Botox.\nBotox is injected directly into the muscles and relaxes muscles by disrupting the communication between the brain and muscles. Botox does this by attaching to nerve endings and prevents them from transmitting signals to the muscles that eventually cause spasms. The number of injections required will be determined by the area treated. Electrical impulses may be used to ensure the injections are working properly. The injection benefits are normally realized a few days after the procedure and then lasts from 3-6 months. The procedure is then repeated every few months to maintain the effectiveness.\nSince, I never tried Botox, I cannot discuss any experienced benefits or side effects. What I can say, is that when my spasticity was removed so was the related pain. I had no idea how much spasticity was truly impacting my quality of life. If you have tried PT, stretching, oral anti-spasticity medications, acupuncture, massage, and other treatments have failed, then you have many options left. Trying Botox would be an experiment that lasted a few months. If you don't like the results, you could stop with relatively little residual damage. Make sure you clearly understand your costs before agreeing to the treatment.\nPlease update us when you can, and I hope whatever treatment you decide on will serve you well.\nYou can read more about Botox here: http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Tre...ications/BOTOX",

Having MS, means you also know things don't always go perfectly according to plan -- so you are better prepared for hiccups along the way. Amazing how MS hardships better prepare you for other areas of your life. Again, Congratulations!\nI cannot comment on Botox and pregnancy. I believe it has not been studied so that conversation is completely between you and your doctor.\nWhat I do know, is that Botox does not travel far from the injection site and far less travels in your blood. That's why it can be used in the face because it travels so little distance from the injection site. So if your injection location is limited, that is exactly what Botox is supposed to help. Based on what you said, it does appear that you match the Botox criteria and match it well. If you proceed, I hope it works amazingly well for you. Please keep us update.

    "Post" : "Originally posted by pennstater View Post\nUntil the FDA is pressured into listing MS Fatigue as usage, we are at our insurer's mercy.\nThat isn't how it works. The FDA doesn't choose what a drug is used for. The use is chosen by the patent holder/manufacturer in their new drug application.\nThe use is chosen by the applicant. The applicant presents clinical data that, it is hoped, demonstrates that the drug is safe (which is a relative term) and effective for the use being applied for. The FDA then approves or rejects the drug for that specific use. The FDA has no influence over what use is chosen, or the use the drug is approved for, other than to agree that the drug is safe and effective for that use.\nBecause drug trials cost multi-millions of dollars, drug companies limit the number of uses applied for in order to keep the cost of the trials down. If there is the potential of profit for other uses, the company will then run more clinical trials for the second purpose. It has to apply for the additional use(s) separately.\nAn example of this is Ampyra, which is approved only to increase walking speed. There doesn't appear to be any potential for profit in testing and applying for another other use.\nAnother example is Tysabri. After it was approved for MS, Biogen did separate trials and applied separately for its approval for treatment of Crohn's disease. Obviously there was the potential for profit in using it to treat another disease.\nThe specific use(s) for a drug is part of the drug's labeling. The FDA doesn't forbid use of drugs off-label, but it forbids drug companies to advertise or in any way promote off-label uses.\nOnce a drug loses patent protection and goes generic, there's no motivation for anyone to do clinical trials to get a new use approved. They can't get another patent for that use because it's the same drug, and there's no way to make back the money that would be spent on drug trials.\nNor does the FDA have any influence over what drugs insurance companies put on their formularies or what uses of the drugs the insurers cover.\nSo that's why the FDA can't be pressured to add an approved use to force an insurer to cover the cost of a drug. They don't control it.",

This past January they denied it again even though I was taking it and it was really making a difference for me. They said I needed to have sleep apnea or narcolepsy to get it approved this year. Ridiculous!\nAnyway had a sleep study to try to get some proof for insurance since I have had sleep issues of waking up every 90 minutes every night. Well I have sleep apnea so got the Modafinil back. Didn't believe I had that and still not sure since I still wake up every 90 minutes with the mask on. Just had second study in the hospital which didn't show sleep apnea so seeing sleep neurologist again this week to decide what's going on.\nI'm afraid though if they take back the diagnosis I'll lose the Modafinil which will mean tough days ahead. I just had to come off Ampyra two weeks ago because I'm having seizures now. Without both not sure if I'll get back to work after I recover from this relapse.\nSorry for going off track but yes some insurances can be real tough on allowing Modafinil for MS.

The discrepancy between the two prices is because the $8 price is obviously a mistake. $80 for 30 200-mg pills is still suspiciously low, but at least it's approaching the realm of reality.\nModafinil is expensive. Even the lowest prices for 30 pills are rarely under $100. So at an average low cost of about $125 for 30 pills, the $243 cost for 60 pills is the realistic one.\nIf you can actually get 30 pills for about $8, that would be a gift.

    "Post" : "Originally posted by pyrmama2 View Post\nWhy didn't steroids work?\nThe steroids probably DID work... at what steroids do. Unfortunately, a lot of people have a mistaken idea idea about what steroids do and are supposed to do. So when steroids don't do what they aren't *supposed* to do, people say they didn't \"work\" and blame the steroids.\nOriginally posted by pyrmama2 View Post\nThe first time I took steroids for double vision, it restored my vision within a few days.\nActually, the steroids did NOT restore your vision. Steroids reduce inflammation. They don't heal anything. They HELP to promote healing by providing a quieter environment in which the body's actual healing processes can take place. Your double vision resolved when the damaged nerves were able to recover their function in an environment of reduced inflammation. The steroids didn't do anything to heal the nerves or restore your vision. Because steroids don't do any healing, they have NO effect on the final outcome of a flare. Research has shown many times that the end result of a flare is the same whether the flare is treated with steroids or not treated with steroids at all.\nThe mistake people make about steroids is that they think steroids affect the final outcome. They don't. So there's no reason to treat with steroids if the only hope is that they'll \"work\" and \"make it better.\" The benefit to steroids is that they *can* -- but there's no guarantee -- reduce the healing *time* and shorten the duration of the symptoms. And they do that by providing that quieter environment that allows the body's own healing processes to take place. And when someone has extensive debility from a flare -- like you do -- there's great benefit in restoring (or trying to) as much function as possible as quickly as possible.\nSo THAT'S why your flare was treated with steroids. In your position I would have done exactly the same thing. And I have done it several times. Here's the critical point. IF not a lot of damage has been done and steroids are administered quickly, that quieter environment can allow nerves to heal quickly and fairly completely. BUT IF too much damage has already taken place before the steroids are administered, there's too much damage to overcome and the nerves can't heal.\nSometimes healing is actually fairly complete, just slow. Sometimes the amount of healing is limited because some of the damage is *already* permanent. Sometimes all of the damage is permanent and there is little to no recovery. All of that damage happened independent of the steroids, and there's nothing steroids can do because they don't heal anything on their own. And when steroids don't do something they aren't supposed to do and can't do, it can't be said that they didn't \"work.\"\nOriginally posted by pyrmama2 View Post\nI did 4 days of solu-medrol and it did absolutely nothing. It's been 5 months and I'm not better.\nI think we've established that the Solu-Medrol probably did quite a lot of what it does. It just wasn't what you wanted it to do. So you can let them off the hook now. :-) Five months isn't really enough time to recover from a body-wide flare. That's not realistic. Recovery can take years. It took me *8* years to recover from a large spinal cord injury. Your body *wants* to recover, and it will to some degree if you give it a chance. But it can't if you keep going back and re-embedding the injury by focusing on it over and over and over. Instead, try embedding your *recovery* by talking about THAT over and over and over. Your brain will go after whatever you tell it to go after. So why not tell it to go after something you want instead of something you don't?",

Research has shown that steroids have NO effect on the final outcome of a flare.\nFurther research has shown that an oral taper also has NO effect on the outcome of a flare, and oral tapers are no longer recommended. If anything, the additional steroid ingested with a taper adds to the risk of additional steroid damage -- diabetes, bone death, osteoporosis, glaucoma -- for no benefit. Does that taper still sound like a good idea?\nThe practice of oral steroid tapers came from diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis that sometimes show rebound flares of inflammation after sudden cessation of high dose steroids. Many years of use of high-dose steroids in MS have shown that MS doesn't have rebound flares. No rebound, no need for a taper. Doctors who don't keep up with practice recommendations might still prescribe tapers, but they're not in the patients' best interest.\nI take high-dose steroids 4 times a year and I haven't done a taper in at least 10 years. My doctor wouldn't prescribe one even if I asked for it.\nAnd certainly, long-lasting effects after a flare has nothing to do with whether a relatively small taper was done 5 months before.\nSo no benefit plus additional risk of harm has eliminated the outdated practice of an oral steroid taper.",

    "Post" : "I didn't know that Tegretol does all that. I started taking it for seizures. One day I had a seizure (scared everyone). So the neuro said seizures aren't from MS so they sent me for an EEG and they said there's nothing in my brain pointing to epilepsy. So then they sent me for an MRI and then said - Ohhh, Your white lesions are overlapping with your gray matter (something like that) so the MS was actually what caused the seizure but it really wasn't an MS problem. So that neuro panicked and put me on a high dosage of tegretol and I felt terribly sick and thought that was the end of me...\nWell it finally worked it out and I took tegretol for 5 years. No problems except I think it makes you tired. (or maybe the MS made me tired ). So after 5 years with no seizures I stopped the tegretol and then 5 years after that I had a seizure. So back to tegretol. I stopped after 5 years but when I started taking ampyro to help my walking I went back to tegretol but only 100 mg/day.\nI'm not in any pain (never was), so maybe the tegretol is what keeps me pain free",

Because the side effects can't clear up quickly, they might seem different.\nOriginally posted by Ikaika View Post\nDoctor and Pharmacist said the 200mg ER is a 24 hour release tablet. But the paperwork that come with the Rx say 12 hour. Anyone in the know?\nYou would do better to rely on the scientific information in the prescribing information, which has been reviewed and approved by the FDA.\nYour doctor and pharmacist are correct that the ER formula has the capability of releasing something over 24 hours. But that doesn't at all mean that the tablets release a perfectly metered amount of medication that is exactly the same over 24 hours and that the med only needs to be taken once every 24 hours. (I can see how your doctor may not understand this, but your pharmacist should know better.)\nThe amount of medication varies over the 24 hours, and the level peaks in the blood somewhere between 3 and 12 hours (which could be why you're waking up swollen and puffy if you take it at bedtime). And that's why, in regular usage, the ER version is taken 2X a day instead of once -- because the peak level should be renewed every 12 hours, not every 24. The normal/conventional tablets peak at about 4-5 hours, and they're usually taken 4X a day to renew the peak level about every 4-5 hours.\nOriginally posted by Ikaika View Post\nThis med seems to be the best choice out of all the other ines for me, so I'm trying to figure how to take it and not swell back up like a balloon.\nIf your body can't release the extended edema that may come with the extended-release med, you may not be a candidate for the ER version. The normal, quicker-acting med may allow the edema to dissipate quickly so it doesn't accumulate and you don't swell up, but the trade-off may be that you'll have to take the med more often. But that might not be so bad if you can get the benefits of the med without accumulated side effects.",

    "Post" : "Hi all,\nI'm 61 yo woman living with Secondary Progressive MS. I've had MS since the beginning of time, and it started before they had DMD's, so I'm a mess.\nMy fatigue has graduated to that level known as \"crippling fatigue.\" I don't need to describe it, I'm sure. I am still walking, with braces on both legs, as my feet no longer evert. I use a walker, walls, husband's jeans waistband, what ever it takes to walk. The neuro has said that people like me, who are still walking in spite of a large disease load, are the patients who have off-the-charts fatigue. So, hurrah for still walking.\nRecently my neuro suggested Aderall, which I had tried and hated many years ago. But, since my fatigue is so much worse now, we thought it may be worth a try. So, I took my 10 mg tablet at 9 on the first day. And, it did give me more focus (I sewed for three hours!). It did not make me feel energetic, it just made me feel like I could do things in spite of the fatigue. And, so I did. And, I paid for that with a great increase in what is already \"crippling\" pain. And, I could not sleep well that night, with a racing feeling lingering from the Aderall. The dosage did give me side effects of racing heart, anxiety, dry mouth, the usual.\nNot one to give up, I got up on day #2 and took my little pill at 8 a.m. And, I had the same results, I sewed for 4 hours! along with some other things. And, I ended up in great pain. And, again I did not sleep well at all.\nThis morning I got up and I felt like I HAD to take that pill. Now there's a feeling I do not want. So, I took 1/2 (5 mgs) and it provided little benefit. So, here I am, fogged out and trashed at 1 p.m., as usual. Soon I will do my usual lay down on the couch which pretty much marks the end of my productivity for the day aside from knitting in the evening.\nI am conflicted because I know that Aderall is Meth and Meth is not a drug to sneeze at. Addiction is rampant with this med, (and I am a 25 year recovered alcoholic) as are long-term side effects and changes in one's brain. Weaning off of it can be a beast. However, I sewed for 4 hours! And that was such a good feeling, to be in my sewing room, doing what I do. However, I do not want to have that feeling at the expense of the health of my brain and personality. If I do stay on it and it continues to interrupt my sleep (in spite of a bomb of pills I take to sleep) then it is game over anyhow.\nI am seriously considering stopping this drug all together before I get in too deep. It's so tough, though, as without this pill, I've got nothing to work with. I do all I can in a day, and just drag on. My morning activities of living like showering, dressing, making the bed, having breakfast, leave me drained to start off the day. And it just goes downhill from there. You'd think with this level of fatigue I'd be willing to take snake oil if it would help.\nAnd, so I turn to all of you to hear from those who have experience with Aderall. BTW, I have tried all of the different supplements and other natural remedies recommended by people here, and all those were was a terrible waste of money. So, I'm not looking for a different solution. I'm looking for advice on this topic, Aderall. (I have in the past also tried Concerta and Ritalin, so those are crossed off the list).\nThank you!!!!!",

    "Post" : "J., Thank you for your thoughtful reply,\nYes, me calling Aderall Meth was a bit of a misleading statement. It's what my family calls it as a \"joke,\" albeit an inaccurate one. I must be more thoughtful when posting on a public forum. It's not my living room!\nAs for trying other supplements, I made a point of saying I'd tried many suggested HERE so as to not waste members' time writing about the list of supplements often recommended in this wonderful forum. I've tried so many things, recommended by my neurologist. Amantadine, B12, prescription Vitamin D, acupuncture, PT, gluten free diet, low carb diet (which I stick to, it's a perfect weight control diet for me) oh my gosh the list is endless. So I guess the answer is yes, I've tried many, many ways to treat this fatigue before we headed to the pharmacy shelves. My neuro is very cautious with that prescription pad of his. I also am working with my PCP, she is going over me head to toe to make sure my thyroid and other parts aren't contributing to this fatigue.\nConcerta's time release gave me really serious insomnia. Ritalin gave me wicked ugly crashes as the dose wore off. Yes, these effects may be different now because I am different now, and perhaps revisiting them will become an option if I do not adjust to Adderall.\nI've had such a wicked progression of this disease in the last year, and there is nothing to be done for those with SPMS. I used to think my fatigue was bad, a few years back. Huh, silly me, I had no idea how bad it can get, and even though it is presently crippling, I realize now that it can still get worse. Every thing has worsened over the past year. Any MS symptom you can come up with, I'm dealing with. Brain, bladder, vision, coordination, foot drop, weakness, swallowing problems, vertigo, falling, total numbness of fingers, .... and more.\nOn 1/2 dose today, I was back to my normal of crippling fatigue. And, when I compare the way I felt today to the way I felt on a full dose, I know that I must give this medication a good go. It seems to be the class of drugs that the neuro believes is necessary for me at this stage, and I must listen to him. (I go to the Partners MS Center in Boston.) So, I'm going to take the full dose every day for the next 2 weeks and reassess then. I'll stick with it no matter what the side effects may become, and see if those side effects level off at all. I really have no choice. For the past year I've been barely living.\nIf you have suggestions for me, bring 'em on. I obviously am in a very bad place right now and will remain open to all suggestions.\nThank you for your kindness!",

    "Post" : "Hello So, and thank you for your input.\nI have cut back to one cup of coffee, trying to slow my racing heart. And, my insurance won't pay for provigil or it's sisters. I did try it, though, as my brother in law has narcolepsy and a big supply of provigil. I raced like mad with absolutely no focus. LOL. It was not pretty. He gets no racing from it, it just stops him from falling asleep at the wheel and other places. I think it's a perfect example of a drug working on a patient who has the disease it was designed to treat. People I know who have real, no bones about it, ADHD take the drugs for it with minor side effects... because they have the disease the drug was designed to treat.\nI did decide to forge ahead committed to take Aderall for two weeks straight and just push until I adjust. 7 days in, that's not feeling so good. I take 10 mg IR at 9 a.m. 1/2 hour later my heart races like a race horse (I'm 61, this is not a good feeling). It levels off a bit and I get 2 hours of focus, initiative, drive, layered on top of my deep fatigue, which does not go away. Around 2 I start to crash and it lasts for hours and is getting worse every day. Total exhaustion without being able to sleep, depressive thoughts, obsessive self-hatred thoughts. It's ugly. Some nights I sleep very poorly, some nights it feels like I didn't sleep at all, and some nights I sleep like the dead.\nThe stomach issues, headaches, blurry vision, dried up mouth, all seem like nothing compared to the crash.\nWorst of all, is I cannot urinate easily, in spite of drinking buckets of water. This is a bigger problem than all the rest, as I have a great big MS bladder problem. I told my neuro about this and his said \"Rats.\" LOL. That's what I say to everything. He pondered that unfortunately I'll probably be self-cathing after I see the urologist in 2 weeks and so it may not matter... as long as I don't get a kidney infection before then. He stated he did not prescribe the XR because he was concerned about bladder problems, and is disappointed to hear the IR has caused them anyways.\nI was believing this was like other meds, that after a while your body will adjust and the side effects will dissipate. From what I've read, that is not the case. There's a whole lotta MS peeps hating the Adderal they are tied to in order to simply get through a day. It's so unfortunate.\nI'm conflicted. I might just have to keep it on hand to use on days that are going to be big (a wedding, a travel day, etc.) and on days without it when I'm in my at home groove, just listen and respond to what my body says. And, ask the neuro about trying LDN, although I know he thinks it's not worth a try. I think when he sees I'm at the end of my rope, he may go for it.",

    "Post" : "Hi HereIam,\nPlease check your blood pressure when using any medication for fatigue.\nThrough the years I have not had much luck taking any medication for fatigue but I tried one last time. From past experiences we decided to try Adderall first. Unrelated to MS or the use of Adderall I had 2 Dr. appointments spaced out from each other by a week.\nMy blood pressure was taken at both appointments. The first appointment my blood pressure was elevated above what is normal for me (I usually run on the lower side). It was chalked up to the appointment. My next appointment my blood pressure was at an even higher level (195/100).\nI am aware medications for fatigue can do this so I decided it wasn't worth taking it (my prescribing Dr. agreed) and stopped. We did try Provigil but the other issue that I was having is similar to yours. Neither medications helped the fatigue, in fact my fatigue increased, but I had more energy and did accomplish more. The downside? I started making more mistakes and forgetting things (a sign I was overly tired).\nI am doing what I have always done --- living my life to the best of my ability even with fatigue.",

    "Post" : "Originally posted by HereIam View Post\n1/2 hour later my heart races like a race horse...I start to crash and it lasts for hours and is getting worse every day. Total exhaustion without being able to sleep, depressive thoughts, obsessive self-hatred thoughts. ... The stomach issues, headaches, blurry vision, dried up mouth, all seem like nothing compared to the crash. ... I cannot urinate easily ... I'm conflicted.\nFaced with doing serious harm to yourself, it's not understandable why you're conflicted. It's pretty clear to anyone whose view isn't distorted by being in your position that none of what you're describing is worth wrecking your health over. Seriously, triggering obsessive self-hatred thoughts just so you can sew for two hours? There's no conflict -- nothing is worth sacrificing your health and happiness.\nOriginally posted by HereIam View Post\nAnd, ask the neuro about trying LDN, although I know he thinks it's not worth a try. I think when he sees I'm at the end of my rope, he may go for it.\nFor you, it probably is worth trying. The top MS specialist in my region at my HMO told me she prescribes it for her patients. Not because it does anything for MS, but because it seems to give them a sense of well-being with few, if any, side effects. That might help you to cope better with your fatigue. I wish you luck -- I hope he does prescribe it for you and that you do well with it.",

    "Post" : "While it's be maybe 10 years, I have tried adderal and provigil. I took provigil for I think maybe 3-4 months. It gave me what I call a fake awake. No energy really just wired but a tired wired. Like I was awake 18 hours and just downed 3 coffees. It also interacted with my birth control so I had to stop taking it. I then tried adderal. I was so high I felt I could rule the world. No extra energy just determination I could do anything....until the crash...then I couldn't do a thing and I was so down in the dumps. Now I know why people take it recreationally but the crash is too depressing to make it worthwhile.\nI totally can get what you are going through. The drug allows you to ignore your body only to pay the price later. High highs then low lows. I couldn't handle the rollercoaster. The highs were not worth the consequences. So I say dump it. Or see if there are more controlled released versions so maybe instead of giving you the drive to sew for 4 hrs you can only do 2 in the am and 2 in the PM. I've recently begun researching ADHD drugs for my daughters impending diagnosis and was surprised all the different stimulants there are now that have slower more controlled releases.\nI think your asking because you know what you should do but feel you are betraying \"what ifs\" if you give it up. Go with your gut.",

    "Post" : "Aderol-my experience\nI have had a similar background with the \"ever increasing\" fatigue throughout the years. In the past, I tried everything that has been mentioned (provigil, nuvigel, Ritalin, several others, including aderol. Like you describe now, none worked and they made me too jittery. So, after many many trials, I just stopped trying to help my fatigue. About 5 years passed and my fatigue had become completely debilitating. I was at the point of not being able to function and as we know, the quality of life keeps decreasing, as more functionality that is lost. So my Dr and I revisited it.\nI tried aderol for the second time. It did take a couple weeks or so to adjust, but I don't have the jittery side effects that I had 5 years ago with the first try. I also have insomnia (have had for 16 years), so I was scared it would keep me up. My Ms Specialist prescribed 10mg aderol twice a day and told me to NOT take the second dose after 3 so it would reduce chances of effecting sleep.\nAt first, I tried just taking the morning 10mg dose, but like you mentioned, the crash comes unforgivingly around mid afternoon and my fatigue was worse than even imaginable!\nI wasn't sure about taking it at all for these reasons, and I knew a second 10 mg dose would keep me up at night. So, I tried taking 1/2 tablet at 2:30-3 pm and it is working out very well now (for about 3 months now). My fatigue is still worse in the afternoon and evening (compared to mornings), but it's ok with me to ensure I don't stay awake all night. I have to set my phone alarm for my 5mg dose in afternoon because if I forget it, I just can't function at all afternoons/evening. And, I absolutely will NOT take the medicine after 3! If I forget it, (and I have, despite turning my alarm off), I just make it through to the next day and accept my worsened condition.\nThis is just my experience and I know everyone is different. My b/p has always been very good thankfully, and the aderol did not effect that.\nIt is helping me, esp in mornings, to at least get some basic things done. To me, it is more depressing to only be able to lay on couch or bed for biggest % of day. And that's how bad it was getting for me as well. For me, the inability to get anything done effected my sense of self worth greatly. So, I'm lucky that for now, it is helping me.\nI hope you find the right solution that will help you and improve your quality of life. And, just because it is working for me at the present, we never know what our next days will be like, so I, too, try to just do the best I can each day. My faith in God has been a huge factor in getting me through difficult times!! Best of wishes to you.",

    "Post" : "Hi Marie and thank you for sharing your experience. It certainly is worthwhile to retry a med that may have been difficult in years gone by. As this disease worsens, the effect of drugs can change.\nI had tried Adderall in 2012 and that was a disaster but I tried again because I am at that point where I am debilitated by fatigue and also by pain. I thought my fatigue was bad in 2012, silly me.\nI came back to finish my story, as I started this thread and wanted to finish it in case people look to it for advice. I'm glad you added your story.\nI kept trying. Taking 5 mg morning, 5 mg at 1 or 10 mg morning, 5 mg mid day.\nI did this for a month. I had to stop for two reasons: the crash did not lighten, it seemed to only get worse. Depression unlike anything I have ever known. And, the second thing was a big surprise to me: Heartburn. Like the depression, unlike any I have ever known. The neuro had me taking double doses of Nexium and others 2 x a day. No coffee, tea, chocolate, tomatoes, etc. The heartburn just did not stop. It was horrid and the neuro decided it may be related to my difficulty swallowing, which often leaves traces of food in my throat. I do tend to get heartburn easily anyhow. So, I drank buckets of water to wash everything down.... which of course filled my gut too much and increased reflux. I was caught in a terrible circle. I kept trying. I had swallowing studies and a scope done of my esophagus, which showed I was developing Barrett's esophagus from all of this madness. So, that was that.\nWhen on Adderall, I never really felt energized, I just felt exhausted but able to do things. And, I could not nap because of the Adderall buzz, even though I felt drained. And, because I could do more, my pain increased.\nSuch a tangled web.\nThis med is so useful for so many people, but I'm not one of them. I'd encourage people suffering from fatigue to try it. You just never know what med will agree with you and which will not, until you try.",

    "Post" : "Hi BDOBBINS,\nI'm wondering if you have talked to prescribing Dr. about this and what risks did s/he say?\nHere's what the FDA says:\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is updating health care professionals and the public about the risk of seizures in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who are starting Ampyra (dalfampridine). Using information received from post-market adverse event reports, FDA recently evaluated seizure risk in MS patients taking Ampyra (dalfampridine). The majority of seizures happened within days to weeks after starting the recommended dose and occurred in patients having no history of seizures.\nIn addition, FDA is updating the Ampyra drug label to clarify recommendations that kidney function should be checked in patients before starting Ampyra and monitored at least annually while Ampyra treatment continues. Additionally, patients who miss a dose should not take extra doses—an extra dose of Ampyra can increase seizure risk.\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm312846.htm\nSometimes I help babysit my grandchild along with her other grandma and I can understand your concern. If your grandchild is old enough to call 911 on their own just in case you do have a seizure, you can be better equipped and somewhat more confident in babysitting alone.\nI took Ampyra awhile back for 6 months. It didn't help my walking at all, so I quit. I never had a seizure, but we are all different! Please don't take any others experience as guidance, and talk with your Dr.\nI hope you can work this all out. Maybe have another adult with you to help babysit while you start Ampyra? Best of luck.",

It has helped with my strength, my walking speed is significantly better (my physical therapist says it is, too) but I really do think this might be due, at least in part, to an awful, months long relapse finally calming down.\nI was diagnosed in March, had 2 rounds of solumedrol (which maybe made me a little worse for a month or two), and am going for my 3rd tysabri infusion Friday. I still have pretty bad gait and balance issues, which my dr thinks are due to spasms, and tremor. He really wants me to take baclofen, but it makes me way too sleepy and I think it makes my tremor and balance worse. I'm taking clonazepam for the tremor, and it does help a lot, but I hate the idea that it's an addictive drug. And if I take the baclofen too, the tremor comes back.\nAnyway, I think maybe the ampyra 2x a day makes my balance worse, too. I forgot evening doses a few times and I really seemed to be better off the next day. I'm really too skinny (I weigh maybe 104-105 lbs, I'm 5'2) so maybe it's just too much for me?\nAnyway, I know this whole post is crazy, I'm sorry for that. I'm just trying to figure out what to do.

    "Post" : "Has anyone ever had botox for spasticity in their lower jaw and/or mouth?\nI have a spastic tongue, had it for years. It was my presenting symptom 20 years ago, before the idea of MS ever came into the picture. Now we know it's MS, and always has been, because I have a lesion in the area of the lower cranial nerves that affect the tongue.\nI've managed it for years with low dose benzos, Baclofen (I still take a low dose of baclofen even though I have a pump..but I take this for my jaw/tongue and upper body spasticity.)\nThe pain is only on one side of my tongue, but my speech has become pretty impaired. I used to be able to distract myself from the pain, but that's not working anymore, I've tried every neurogenic pain med there is, but they don't work because it's really not sensory pain, it's plain old muscle spasm/spasticity pain...so now we're looking into botox.\nBotox had been recommended years ago by a neuro but all the 2nd opinions from other neuros I trusted said only do it when all else has failed. So I'm about at that point where I'm going to have to do something, or quit talking and chewing...that's what triggers the spasm. The caveat to just going ahead and doing it has always been, it could make the situation worse, speaking and swallowing at least.\nI've had a swallow test, I've been to a speech therapist, and my swallowing is okay, some deficits, but okay. Speech therapist says there is nothing speech therapy can do for me.\nBut it's either going to be heavier pain med, no talking, soft foods only, or some other type of treatment, so botox is being investigated. I've been referred to the neuro in the practice that does EMGs, so I think that will be the next move just to see what nerves are firing and which aren't...I have fasciculations on the one side of my tongue that never stop and muscles of my jaw and neck have atrophied quite a lot.\nGood news is: botox results only last 3 months, so eventually if it was bad side effects, they'd wear off. Bad news is: could I go 3 months without talking (i.e. it could make the speaking worse and my speech would become more unintelligible.)\nIt took me awhile to wrap my head around the whole idea of the pump...but this side of it, I was so glad I didn't listen to my own misgivings. So maybe this will be the same.\nI'd love to hear from somebody who's had botox in that region and the side effects caused, specifically swallowing and speaking.",

Knowing you've had Botox in you neck and head with none of the side effects makes me feel much better about Botox shots. All the warnings about swallowing, etc were rather daunting. Your post really helped me have a more balanced view of the injections.",

    "Post" : "Tongue problems here too\nHello!\nI have had stiffness in my tongue for ten years. However, the main culprit is most probably an operation I had done to my tongue right before. The injured muscle never recovered from the operation in the sense that I feel the area getting stiffer on its own. The stiff feeling comes and goes, on a daily basis usually. Years later, it has become worse. It has spread into the base of my tongue which nowadays feels like getting stiff, too. I tend to describe the feeling like what a man probably feels when he gets an erection, only that it's the tongue\nI was diagnosed with ms soon after the operation. I think I had ms already before, but the operation and everything related to it was such a stress to my physical and mental health, that it triggered the ms to rear its head and I got the diagnosis.\nDoctors think that the spastic feelings I have in my tongue can be both operation related and ms related or that it's impossible to know which one to blame or both.\nI'm so happy to hear of someone else with this weird problem.",

    "Post" : "re: Botox\nHello,\nI have suffered with jaw/mouth pain since April 2011, approx. a month after I was diagnosed with MS it started. It took my neuro forever (it seemed like) to finally diagnose me correctly. She was treating me for Trigeminal Neuralgia when I actually had Oro-facial Dystonia. The treatments are very different.\nAnyway, long story short, I get Botox injections into my jaw (both sides) and scalp (covers the masseter muscles) every 90 days and have for years. It was life changing!!!\nIt was so bad that chewing food, chewing gum, laughing, or talking too much exacerbated the problem. Soft foods became a routine; my teeth hurt, my jaw hurt, which made my head hurt...until she realized I needed Botox to fix the problem.\nAs long as I stay on my 90 day cycle I'm good to go and I have a much better quality of life.\nGood luck.",

    "Post" : "Hi Grade1 and Mlissa,\nI just saw this thread was \"resurrected\" and found your stories very interesting.\nGrade1, mine feels stiff too, and it won't move. If they say stick out your tongue and say\n\"Ah\"....I can't stick out my tongue, in fact the Ah sound seems to cause it to retreat more down my throat...but this is all one sided issues.\nUpdate to the problem: I was sent to the dystonia, and botox neuro for his opinion. After examining me, he said there was really no fix because my tongue has atrophied on that side, and the muscles are too weak to make it move \"right.\" That whole side of my face is not cooperative at all My lip droops and the face itself doesn't move (with the exception of my forehead...it moves, but evidently that's a different nerve that innervates the forehead. In fact, I believe the way they differentiate Bell's Palsy is if the forehead moves or not.)\nIf it wasn't for the strange sensations, and down right pain that I get when I overdo it (i.e. talk too much, eat something that requires a lot of chewing, or try to eat a thick sandwich or corn on the cob, for that matter)...I wouldn't be concerned about the cosmetic aspect...but it's the pain and altered sensations that drive me batty. They did up my nortriptylene and that did help some. I also take oral baclofen (I have a baclofen pump for lower body spasticity) and a small dose of Klonopin for the face/tongue issues. I really didn't think it helped much, but the other day I forgot and skipped a dose. I was trying to figure out why I was having so many problems with the area, and then realized I missed a dose...so the anti-spasticity, and muscle relaxer do help.\nMlissa, so glad you've had such great success with the botox. That's what I was hoping I could get, but the botox neuro said it probably wouldn't help and where he'd need to inject was the one place he had never botoxed in his career. He indicated the place that would need to be treated with botox would compromise my swallowing.\nBut I'm thrilled to hear it has worked for you. There's a youtube video on oromandibular dystonia, and the man (he doesn't have MS...just the dystonia) who did the video had great success with using a mouthpiece (looks likes a retainer) and eventually botox. It's a really interesting video...you can use oromandibular dystonia in the youtube search engine and come up with his story.\nThanks to both of you for sharing your experiences.",
