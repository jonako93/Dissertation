    "Post" : "UPDATE: FDA-Approved Oral Bafiertam™ (Monomethyl Fumarate) Now Available for Prescription\nSeptember 1, 2020\n(Originally released in May 3, 2020; Updated with additional details)\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Bafiertam™ (monomethyl fumarate, Banner Life Sciences) in late April 2020 as an oral disease-modifying therapy for adults with relapsing forms of MS. Bafiertam (pronounced bah”feer’tam) is similar to Tecfidera® and Vumerity® but has a distinct chemical structure. This therapy is now available for prescription.\n>Relapsing forms of MS includes people with clinically isolated syndrome (an initial episode of neurological symptoms), relapsing-remitting MS, and active secondary progressive MS. People with active secondary progressive MS have had progression of disability but still experience acute relapses or new MRI activity.\n>Although their exact mechanisms of action are not known, fumarate therapies are thought to modulate the immune response underlying MS to be less inflammatory, and may have antioxidant properties that could be protective against damage to the brain and spinal cord.\n>Because of its similarity to Tecfidera, Bafiertam’s approval was based largely on the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy for Tecfidera and “bioavailability” studies in healthy subjects comparing dimethyl fumarate to Bafiertam. Twice-daily Tecfidera was shown in clinical trials to significantly reduce relapses and disease activity on MRIs, and in one trial it reduced progression of disability.\n>People prescribed Bafiertam will take a lower dose for one week, and then a maintenance dose of two capsules taken by mouth twice a day.\n>The price of Bafiertam has been announced as $69,480 per year. The actual cost to individuals will depend on the provisions of their insurance coverage and the degree to which they will be eligible for programs designed to assist with out-of-pocket costs.\nMore info:\nhttps://www.nationalmssociety.org/Ab...ethyl-Fumarate)",

    "Post" : "Early use of high efficacy disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) is more effective than the traditional approach — that of an escalating treatment regimen — at delaying disability progression in people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), a real-life study from Italy reports.\nPeople later moving to more aggressive treatment also appeared to benefit less from it than those treated intensively from the start, its researchers said.\nThe traditional and most frequently used approach in treating RRMS supports the use of moderately effective DMTs, which generally have good safety profiles. Patients then move to higher-efficacy DMTs as needed, according to disease progression.\nWhile high-efficacy DMTs for RRMS have a consistently superior effect on disease activity than the traditional first-line MS DMTs, they are usually associated with greater risks. For this reason, they are often reserved for high-risk patients with poor prognosis.\nHowever, increasing data suggest that RRMS patients may benefit more from upfront use of the most efficacious DMTs — an approach called early intensive therapy, or EIT — than from the standard escalating regimen (ESC). EIT may manage the disease in its early, inflammatory phase, preventing irreversible damage and long-term disability.\nResearchers in Italy evaluated the long-term disability trajectories of a large group of RRMS patients treated with EIT or a standard escalating regimen in a real-life setting.\n“Whether patients initiating high-efficacy DMTs as their 1st therapy derive a greater long-term benefit on disability progression than those who start with the 1st-line agents and then switch to high-efficacy DMTs, remains a matter of debate,” Iaffaldano said.\nA total of 2,652 RRMS patients, each with at least five years of follow-up, a first visit within three years of disease onset, and three or more disability assessments after starting a DMT, were selected from the Italian MS Registry.\nPatients were treated and followed at 62 MS centers in that country, and their disability was measured through the expanded disability status scale (EDSS).\nThe EIT group included 365 patients treated with Gilenya (fingolimod, by Novartis), Tysabri (natalizumab, by Biogen), Novantrone (mitoxantrone), Lemtrada (alemtuzumab, by Sanofi-Genzyme), Ocrevus (ocrelizumab, by Genentech), or Mavenclad (cladribine, by EMD Serono) as a first disease-modifying treatment. (EMD Serono is known as Merck KGaA outside North America.)\nThe ESC group included 2,337 patients who moved to a high-efficacy DMT after at least one year of treatment with Copaxone (glatiramer acetate, by Teva Pharmaceuticals), various interferons, azathioprine (sold as Azasan and Imuran), Aubagio (teriflunomide, by Sanofi Genzyme), or Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate, by Biogen).\nThe effectiveness of these two treatment approaches was then assessed by looking at mean annual changes in disability, via patients’ EDSS scores, for up to 10 years, as compared with scores before DMT initiation.\nTo help ensure valid comparisons, patients in the escalating treatment (ESC) group were matched as best as possible at baseline (therapy start) by characteristics like age, sex, EDSS scores, etc., to those in the early intensive treatment (EIT) group. In total, the researchers looked at data covering 365 pairs of matching patients.\nThese people had mild to moderate disability, with a mean EDSS score of 2.61 in the EIT group and 2.63 in the ESC group, before starting a first DMT. Patients were followed by a median of 8.5 years (range of 6.5–11.7 years).\nAll in the escalating regimen moved to a higher-efficacy DMT after a median of 5.1 years (range: 3.1–8.4 years). Most (93.11%) had started with an injectable DMT (such as the interferons and Copaxone), before escalating to Tysabri (42.98%) or Gilenya (38.84%).\nAmong EIT patients, the most common first high-efficacy DMT used was Tysabri (40.77%), followed by Novantrone (38.84%).\nSignificantly higher annual EDSS changes were seen in ESC group patients than in those on the EIT regimen at each follow-up year, indicating faster disability progression in people on the standard escalating regimen.\nNotably, EDSS score differences between the two groups increased from 0.10 at one year to 0.30 at five years, and to 0.67 at 10 years.\n“Our results indicate that EIT strategy is more effective than ESC strategy in controlling disability progression and the effect tends to increase over time despite patients in the ESC group escalated to a higher-efficacy DMT,” the researchers wrote.\n“This could be due to a more potent effect on disability progression of the high-efficacy DMTs in the early years of the disease or alternatively, to the longer exposure to them,” Iaffaldano said.\nHe noted further studies are needed to confirm these results, and to establish the long-term safety of the EIT approach. Still, these findings may help clinicians making treatment decisions, “in particular in the cases of naive patients [those with no prior treatment] with poor prognosis factors at the onset of disease,” Iaffaldano added.\nhttps://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.c...al-life-study/",

By suppressing these cells, the therapy is expected to limit neurodegeneration in progressive forms of the disease.\n~ In conclusion, the trial’s results showed that the low dose of masitinib had a sustained and significant benefit in disability progression in a broad population of progressive MS patients over two years, suggesting that the therapy “may provide a new treatment option for PPMS and non-active SPMS,” Vermersch said.\nThe researcher also noted that masitinib’s safety profile “is suitable for long-term administration.”\nIn AB Science’s release, Vermersch noted: “Masitinib can be administered on a long-term basis as it is not an immunosuppressive treatment, which is particularly important in patients who are to receive long-term treatment and who, for some, have already an immune system weakened by previous treatments or because of their age.”\nhttps://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.c...02-study-show/",

I took rebif for some time so injections don’t scare me. But long infusions are a hassle.\nOfatumumab was compared head to head with Aubagio can was shown to be a superior medication (on average).\nIt's impossible to know if it's a better drug than Ocrelizumab, but here are a few thoughts:\n- Ocrelizumab is humanized, while Ofatumumab is fully human. This should decrease the chance of developing neutralizing antibodies. Developing neutralizing antibodies is even a bigger problem with Rituximab that is chimeric in nature. Treatment induced anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) were detected in 2 of 914 (0.2%) KESIMPTA-treated patients; no patients with treatment enhancing or neutralizing ADAs were identified.\n- a number of patients report breakthrough activity before their next 6 month Ocrelizumab infusion. These people may be experiencing early b-cell repopulation. With monthly dosing it's unlikely that b-cells would ever repopulate.\n- as you mentioned, Ofatumumab is a self-injected so infusions are no longer required. I'm a difficult IV stick so this medication would remedy that problem for me.\n- all three b-cell depleting therapies bind slightly differently to the CD20 cells so one could work better for you than the others.\n- there's recent research that shows Ocrelizumab may negate the effects of vaccines. With Rituximab and Ocrelizumab, timing can be used to try to maximize and potential benefit. With a monthly injection it could reduce the effectiveness of vaccines even further and is mentioned in the prescribing information. This could hinder the effectiveness of a covid vaccine.\n- normally Ocrelizumab is infused with steroids and other premedications. These additional medications are not necessary for Ofatumumab injections.\n- the side effect profile of each medication is different so you may tolerate one better than another. Upper respiratory infections are more likely in Ofatumumab so that could be a covid concern.\n- with 12 injections you have more opportunities for medication reactions. Many people feel side effects after Ocrelizumab infusions, but that's only twice per year. If you have injection reactions (greater than 10%) every dose you could end up with more days of recovery.\n- it's worth noting that, like Rituximab, the dosing of Ofatumumab for MS patients is much lower than for cancer patients\n- Ocrelizumab infusions of 2.5 hours have been approved in Europe and will probably be approved here in the US before long.",

I have been using glasses for a long time and last month I have consulted an ophthalmologist. After doing some tests, he suggested me undergoing laser eye surgery to get a permanent solution. Even the surgery was planned by the starting of April. But I don't think it will be possible due to COVID-19. I'm really worried about my vision. As the self-quarantine days are going most of the ophthalmologists are not available.\nI'm not so sure of going outside as well. What will I do guys? Does it will get better after some time. I'm not sure whether its the problem of the glasses I use. Share your suggestions.\nThanks!",

Any feedback would be much appreciated.\nThanx a lot!!\nShortly after diagnosis, my neurologist recommended I try Ampyra to see if it helped with my walking. It was new, and she said 30% found it very helpful, 30% found it somewhat, and 30% found it helped not at all. The company, Acorda, was subsidizing the cost so my out-of-pocket was only $40.\nI was on it for 6 years, and for several years I really felt it was helping. However, with Medicare around the corner, and the cost of the drug would no longer be subsidized, I decided to try 4AP, the compounded form of Ampyra. It was the same price, and I actually felt it worked better.\nI did 4AP for a couple years, but then I decided to try removing all the drugs I was on to see what the effect was. Surprisingly, I found I was fine without them all, and now the only drug I'm on is Tysabri, and I've even reduced that to once every 49 days.\nLooking back, I'm wondering if my time on Ampyra couldn't be filed under the \"placebo\" affect; it was working because I believed it was working.\nI'd say give it a go if the cost isn't prohibitive. You'll know almost immediately if it's working for you, and if not you can quit. It never affected me in a negative way, and I had no problem stopping it cold turkey.

    "Post" : "I thought this was a helpful article explaining how certain drugs are given their names:\nMaking Sense of Monoclonal Antibodies\nThe amount of available monoclonal antibodies (–mabs) has increased in the past few years, and their targeted nature is treating everything from cancer to high cholesterol.\nUnfortunately, –mabs are a source of confusion for many pharmacists. Their names are long and complicated, and they all sound the same.\nAs it turns out, –mabs aren’t too bad once you get to know them. They’re named based on an established process, and a –mab’s name actually tells you quite a lot about it.\nLet’s break down the nomenclature and discuss a few clinical pearls.\nRule 1\nThese drugs all end in the suffix “–mab,” so you should know the type of drug when you see it.\nRule 2\nThe 1 or 2 letters preceding –mab tell you the source of the antibody.\nThese drugs are made by collecting antibodies from some source, which are then distilled down until there are many, many copies of the same antibody. The source is usually human, mouse, or some combination of the 2.\nHere's a quick rundown of the most common prefixes:\n* -o-: mouse (all mouse)\n* -xi-: chimeric (part human, part\nnonhuman)\n* -zu-: humanized (mostly human,\npart nonhuman)\n* -u-: human (all human)\nRule 3\nThe 1 or 2 letters before the source tell you where in the body the –mab works. Here’s a quick list of the most common targets:\n* -c(i)-: circulatory system\n* -k(i)-: interleukin\n* -l(i)-: immune system\n* -t(u)-: tumor\nThat’s not an exhaustive list, but it covers most of the –mabs you’ll encounter.\nRule 4\nThere’s no set nomenclature before the target; drug developers are just asked to provide something that flows well with the rest of the name.\nOne last thing to mention about nomenclature: how biosimilars are named is still up for debate. The current recommendation by the FDA is to include a suffix of 4 random letters.\nBecause this is a new area, there aren’t many examples. The first biosimilar –mab currently on the US market is infliximab-dyyb (Inflectra).\nClinical Pearls\nNow that we’ve covered the nomenclature, how can we use it to our advantage?\nFor starters, if you encounter a new –mab, you can at least generally determine where it works in the body. If you see alemtuzumab, you know it works on tumors (-tu-) and is derived from a humanized source (-zu-). If you didn’t know evolocumab is a PCSK9 inhibitor, you’d at least know the drug works in the circulatory system (-c-) and is fully human (-u-).\nSecond, the source of the antibody can be used to predict the risk of infusion reactions.\nEven if they’re from a fully human source, –mabs are foreign proteins, so there’s a relatively high risk of infusion reactions during administration. The risk of reaction is highest with the first couple of infusions and the most foreign source, so a chimeric –mab that’s 50% mouse- and 50% human-derived will generally have a higher reaction risk than a fully human –mab.\nHere’s a quick rundown of infusion reaction risk based on –mab type:\n* –momab (highest risk)\n* –ximab\n* –zumab\n* –mumab (lowest risk)\nThere are exceptions, of course. The recently-approved daratumumab (Darzalex) has an astounding 48% risk of infusion reaction.\nInfusion reactions can be somewhat mitigated by premedication. Often, a combination of acetaminophen and diphenhydramine (plus or minus a steroid like methylprednisolone) are given 30 minutes before infusion.\nManaging infusion reactions usually starts with stopping the infusion and administering IV steroids and/or diphenhydramine. From there, the infusion can be restarted at half the rate it was running previously. If patients react again, they most likely shouldn’t be rechallenged; it’s time to consider another therapeutic option.\nFinally, don’t forget –mabs have other side effects not related to infusion reactions. Although they’re highly targeted by design, there are still risks. For example, trastuzumab (Herceptin) is an antibody directed at the HER2 receptor used in certain breast and stomach cancers, and it has an up to 34% rate of cardiotoxicity. Meanwhile, bevacizumab (Avastin), an antibody directed at VEGF, can cause hypertension, proteinuria, and even GI perforation.\nThis only scratches the surface of possibilities for –mabs. In certain areas like oncology, they’re becoming mainstays of treatment. The more we know about –mabs, the more we’ll be able to help our patients and the health care team.\nhttps://www.pharmacytimes.com/contri...nal-antibodies",

    "Post" : "Hi KatW,\nOcrevus is specifically approved for MS. It is a humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (monoclonal antibody = made in a laboratory). It targets CD20 marker on B lymphocytes and is an immunosuppressive drug.\nRituxan (Rituximab) is FDA approved for Rheumatoid Arthritis and used \"off label\" for MS. Rituxan is a chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody. It is a chemotherapy drug.\nOcrevus binds to a different but overlapping region on B cells than Rituxan does. Since Ocrevus is derived mostly from human antibodies, it induces less of an immune response to foreign antigens. Ocrevus is thought to bind more to CD20 than Rituxan. For these reasons, it is thought to have a more favorable benefit to risk profile in MS.\nThere are no published studies with Ocrevus for RA. So there's no scientific data to determine how well it may or may not work for that condition.\nThere are also no published studies that directly compare Ocrevus and Rituxan in treating MS.\nOcrevus is associated with fewer infusion-related reactions because it is a humanized antibody. Studies of Ocrevus have revealed an increased risk of breast cancer, while the limited studies of Rituxan in MS did not reveal a similar risk.\nInsurance companies may not cover \"off-label\" treatments used for MS, so depending on your insurance, you may need it prescribed for your RA.\nRituxan is also used with Methotrexate in the treatment of RA. The dosing schedule may be different than for MS. I believe it may be more frequent, but that is something to ask your rheumatologist. Rituxan is usually prescribed for RA if you haven't responded well to other treatments. (This is also sometimes the case with MS disease modifying therapies.)\nYour rheumatologist might have more insight on that, and if feels this medication is warranted for you, can make a case to persuade your insurance company to cover it if there is a problem. My neurologist made a case for me when he prescribed a different drug (also used \"off-label\" for MS).\nYour neurologist would most likely have your rheumatologist prescribe the medication for you if chosen to treat your RA as well. I hope they will work together to determine the best treatment and who should prescribe it for you.\nBest of luck and please keep us updated.",

    "Post" : "Hi KatW,\nAdditional information about prescribing Rituxan for Rheumatoid Arthritis:\nRiituximab (Rituxan) is approved by\nThe Food and Drug Administration in combination with Methotrexate for the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more TNF antagonist therapies.\nIt is only approved as a second line therapy. This classification refers to a drug that may only be prescribed when other FDA-approved treatments fail or are not tolerated well by a patient. The MS drug Lemtrada has been given the same classification by the FDA. It is not prescribed before other appoved treatments fail.\nIn another thread, you mentioned you are on Plaquenil, which is not a TNF therapy.\nThe drugs in this class include Remicade (infliximab), Enbrel (etanercept), Humira (adalimumab), Cimzia (certolizumab pegol) and Simponi (golimumab).\nWhile there are some cases where patients have been approved for a second line therapy before failing others first, the odds may not be in your favor.\nSo your neurologist would more likely need prescribe it for your MS. Methotrexate would not be prescribed in combination with it, though.\nFor RA, it is typically prescribed every six months, up to.every four months if needed. For MS, it's prescribed every six months. The dose is the same for both conditions, 1,000 mg.\nWorth a discussion with your doctors if you'd like to consider taking this drug.\nBest of luck!.",

    "Post" : "Rituximab was never approved for MS because the patent was running out and wasn't worth the huge clinical trials investment.\nDespite the release of Ocrelizumab, I remain on rituximab and have little reason to change. It's subdued previously active MS that 6 other medications could not. Rituximab has been on the market for many years and we have a lot of knowledge about its safety profile.\nOcrelizumab, while similar, has already shown an increase in cancer rates unseen in rituximab. Why this is happening is not clearly understood. For me, the biggest reason to select Ocrelizumab over rituximab is the much lower rate of developing neutralizing antibodies. The lower rate is attributed to Ocrelizumab being humanized versus the chimeric nature of rituximab.\nDosing is generally the same, but there's no set protocol for rituximab (since it's off-label). I now get 500 mg every 6 months which is fairly common in the MS/Rituximab community.\nMany insurance companies readily approve rituximab because it's considerably cheaper than Ocrelizumab. Recently more insurance companies are even moving patients from rituximab to Truxima, a biosimilar medication.\nI wish you well...",

    "Post" : "\"After age 65, continue or de-escalate DMT'\nReally a great conversation starter because it is a question virtually all pwMS on a DMT will face at some point.\nRisk - Reward balance with MS DMTs is possibly the most nuanced of any disease in existence. Individually, there are a ton of unique factors involved and as always with MS, one size decidedly DOES NOT fit all. But it is helpful to hear from each individual MSer how they approach the excellent question presented.\n\"if it ain't broke don't fix it\" is very sound thinking, I believe. If someone is having good or great results on an effective DMT and suffering little or no side effects (as has been the case with the great majority of folks I have known personally taking Tysabri) then continuing that course seems prudent.\nAt least two people here have recently mentioned they didn't realize how crappy they felt on Avonex until they stopped taking it and went on Tysabri. So, two factors... the first is how crappy they felt with Avonex and the second is how much better they felt on Tysabri. My spouse, btw, agrees with that assessment.\nHowever, what if she and they had only stopped taking Avonex? Would they have felt less crappy even though MS had the chance of becoming more active? No one knows for sure. I tend to take a mathematical probability approach to much of my thinking and comment about MS DMTs and issues around them. So, with that in mind, I express my opinion as follows...\nI believe there is a high probability that most people taking Avonex would feel better not taking it because of the crappy side effects. But would their MS get worse if they stopped? Some may, especially younger than age 55 patients. Trials typically have an age cut off of 55 so we have little evidence, sometimes none, of effectiveness over age 55 in most MS DMTs. Please do not believe for a moment that the age cut-off is random; such thinking is terribly naive. Drug companies want their drug to look as good as possible so they omit populations which are likely to show decreasing effectiveness.\nThe sparse effect most MS meds have in those younger than age 55 seems to disappear gradually over age 55 from what I understand. And, concerning disability progression, there is no evidence I have seen the CRAB drugs have much, if any, benefit regarding disability progression at any age.\nIf you feel crappy on a CRAB drug while it has minimal impact on MS... well, I can understand why some people stop... they want to feel better. Certainly, over age 65, they could easily stop for a year to see how they felt and the very high probability is that stopping would have no effect on their MS. Likely, they would feel better minus the crappy side effects.\nAn interjection here... the things Mamabug and others do... exercise, diet, etc. are in my opinion, likely to have as much effect, or more, than the CRAB drugs and certainly only help those who are taking CRAB drugs in combination with those things.\nAlso, I'm a fan of LDN, ALA, and EGCG (not overdone with drinking green tea being the best form of EGCG). My guess is that those 3 things are more beneficial in MS than any of the CRAB drugs. I would love to see those 3 things trialed against CRAB drugs. IMO, all the CRAB drugs would largely disappear after that trial.\nBut what about MS DMTs beyond the CRABs? Are there good reasons to continue taking them? Yes, I believe so. Tysabri has proven it preserves hand and arm function in SPMS. Most RRMS transitions into SPMS at some point in age and if/when you get there, if you are not walking as well you sure as heck want your hands and arms to work well.\nEffective meds likely delay the transition from RRMS to SPMS, as do other things. Smokers, for example, transition to SPMS 7-8 years sooner than non-smokers, according to Sweden's national registry of MSers.\nIn conclusion, IMO, after age 65 most could stop CRAB drugs, experience no difference in MS and feel better minus those DMTs. But those having success on an effective DMT could very well benefit from continuing. JMHO.",

    "Post" : "Originally posted by kmallory1 View Post\nI was on Avonex for several years. As soon as Tysabri was approved I went off Avonex. As Pennstater said, I didn’t realize how bad Avonex made me feel until I stopped.\nThe responses by pennstater and kmallory1 prodded my thinking... both halted Avonex and felt better. I believe there is solid evidence supporting that would be the case with most people taking Avonex.\nThe next observation is that Tysabri did not make them feel as crappy as Avonex. My wife concours; so that makes 3 people. She was on Avonex briefly when Tysabri was off market in late 2005.\nThe next immediate question is... would halting Avonex make much of a difference in controlling MS? Possibly, possibly not. What we do know is that it makes very little difference relative to disability progression. In fact, beyond age 54, I have yet to see hard evidence Avonex makes any difference at all relative to disability progression.\nTreatment decisions are deeply personal and individually tailored. That said, I suppose those who are less risk averse might stop Avonex after a certain age and see if it matters, for better or worse. There are some DMTs which present huge potential problems going cold turkey and doing so is not wise, IMO. Avonex would not be one of those.\nNot sure how this will be received but it is part of the conversation discussing MS DMTs...\nDr. George Ebers, neurologist, MS researcher, Head of Clinical Neurology, University of Oxford, speaking...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0m_...ture=emb_title",

Now, I have motivation to stop interferons by age 65! A Pincushion No More! LOL Overall, I am \"grateful\" that my MRIs have been stable the past 14 years (only one small flare in 2007 left side numbness --- optic neuritis in 2003 but MRI compared to 2018 scan was dated 2004).\nBack in 1994, Betaseron was on a lottery, and I was 26 and just dx. My neuro said \"young women\" tend to do well with MS. To basically, \"live my life\" blah blah blah. . . In 1997, I had left-side lower quadrant blind spots in my line of vision (thalamus lesion). Went back to neuro, new MRI (1997-1994), showed drastic \"silent progression.\" Neuro said I was lucky three times and to start Avonex as soon as possible!\nFear is a great motivator! Twenty two years later, \"I still look so good\" (damn how I hate that saying too!), I wrapped up my BS and earned my Master's degree while working full time and fell into a career I loved. Fatigue and cognitive issues forced early retirement, but I am \"grateful\" for any help Avonex has given me along my journey.\nAgain, thanks to all for your feed back! Happy Holidays!",

I don't know if it pertains to me, but sometimes I wonder?\nI'm curious, why do most folks switch MS txs? Obviously, I think \"MRI changes, disability progression, etc., but does anyone switch because something \"new\" comes along? But is \"new\" \"better?\"\nI was dx in 1994 (age 26), started Avonex September 1997 (age 29), and remain on it today. Although I've had a few minor relapses (2003; 2007) my MRI's remained stable. And my neuro always said \"stay on Avonex\" to me after reviewing my MRI's etc.\nAs I'm now in my early 50's, I wonder if it's simply age that is making me feel worse (increasing fatigue & cognitive dysfuntion)? Despite stable MRI's, how many folks have switched tx's? But, is the devil you know better than the devil you don't? Meaning \"comfort, stability, usual side-effects, long safety profile, etc.\"\nMy usual neuro retired, new neuro said if we see any changes on new MRI, I recommend switching to Ocrevus. MRI=no changes (stable in lesion size and number when comparing 2004 MRI to 2018 MRI). Wow, that's a long time, huh? Perhaps, I need to quit \"over thinking things\" and be \"grateful\"?\nAnyone here want to share their experiences. . . . .happy holidays!\nGood question.\nI've been on Copaxone since 2008. In response to your question, I guess the reason, for a lot of years, that I didn't switch is that my MS Specialist said that if a med seems to be working, it's probably best to stay on it. I second reason is that the potential side effects of some of the newer meds scare me. Is the devil you know better than the devil you don't? Maybe.\nThree or four years ago (I'm 57 now), I did begin to notice a decline. At that point, she suspected that the decline was related to transitioning to SPMS. Perhaps I would have begun asking questions about a possible switch (although the side effects are still worrisome to me!), but after beginning some dietary and lifestyle changes, I've been stable the past 18 months or so.\nI did make a switch in 2008, after 5 years on Betaseron. It wasn't effective for me; I wish I would have switched sooner.",

    "Post" : "Ok all my MS had gotten to the point that I couldn't really walk much anymore and if I could I'd end up falling out. And my spasms where so bad I'd be just laid up in bed most of the time and it has been such a struggle. I used to be so active even when I'd have to swing my left leg or drag it. But it got to the point with my legs that I couldn't even stand to pee allot of the time and still I get like that in the afternoon. But after starting ampyra I've been trying to walk more but I still get so afraid because I still keep falling even with using a walker. Just not everyday like before.\nNow before this med I'd get these spasms that would last for hours on end. And what I call my spasms are like this. I'll be laying down and all of a sudden my left arm and leg will just start jumping around and then straight up in the air. Sorta like doing leg lifts. But I'd be lucky if I can lift my legs 6 inches to a foot before the medicine. Even with the ampyra I have trouble with the leg lifts. And I'm still having falls. This past Sunday I fell twice and yesterday once while using the walker.\nNow from some of what I've read is that the medicine can cause kidney failure along with seizures. Haven't had no seizures. But like Saturday during the night my bladder gave out on me. I don't think that has anything to do with kidneys does it?\nMy biggest concern is that I might have to stop taking the medicine and then I'll be back to being stuck in my wheelchair and bed again and all I want is to get better so I can try and be able to try and take care of myself instead of having to have help to get in and out of the shower at times as well as to get dressed and not be able to stand very long to even cook for myself. Now I only started this medicine last Friday. And it's like someone has flipped a switch to make my nerves work properly. And the other issue is that I don't think my insurance will cover it again. I have Medicare part D for meds. Anyone else go from not being able to walk to being able to after starting ampyra?",

    "Post" : "Bobby72,\nFirst, I encourage you to read my post in the thread Ampyra if you haven't already. By the sounds of it, you might be in the 30% of those who see a marked improvement with Ampyra, and that is a good thing.\nAs far as seizures or kidney failure, I was personally on Ampyra for 6 years, and I never heard or read of anyone experiencing these. Remember, companies have to report ANYTHING negative that happens with a drug, even if it only happened once. You should always be cautious with a drug, but don't get too worked up. I actually made the mistake of taking an extra Ampyra, forgetting I had already taken one, and I was just fine.\nYeah, Ampyra is an expensive drug. I actually quit once I knew it wouldn't be subsidized under Part D, and I just didn't see the value to me at that point in time. I actually transitioned to 4-AP, the compounded form of Ampyra. It was the precursor to Ampyra, and the only difference is Ampyra is extended release. Instead of one every 12 hours, you take one pill every 3-4 hours, depending. This actually gives you more control of the drug.\n4-AP can be purchased from a compounding pharmacy, and I paid $46 including shipping for 120 pills. I used Skip's Pharmacy in Deerpark, Florida. I could recommend you give 4-AP a try to see if you still have a positive effect.\nI eventually quit 4-AP because I just didn't see the positive effects you are seeing. I hope it continues to help you.",

Obviously there must be a chance your immune system goes on a rampage on your body and more so with MS.

    "Post" : "Shingrix notes from NMSS\nA few months back I asked my neuro about Shingrix. She didn't get an answer but here is what the NMSS says.\nThe CDC recommends Shingrix, a non-live vaccine for the prevention of herpes zoster (shingles) and related complications. The vaccine, which is given in two doses separated by 2 to 6 months, is recommended over Zostavax® (the previously approved vaccine for shingles). Shingrix is approved for adults 50 years and older:\nwhether or not they have had a prior episode of herpes zoster or have had a dose of Zostavax\nwho have a chronic medical condition, unless there is a specific reason why the individual should not have it\nwho are getting other adult vaccines such as influenza and pneumococcal (pneumonia) vaccines\nNo studies of Shingrix have been done in people with MS. However, in two clinical studies with Shingrix, there was no increase in immune-mediated conditions.\nThe CDC indicates that a person who is taking a low-dose immunosuppressive therapy or is going to begin taking an immunosuppressive medication can take Shingrix. It is very important to discuss this vaccine with the healthcare provider who is treating your MS to ensure that it is appropriate for you.\nMy next Ocrevus infusion is in October - I will try to get this shot in early July.",

I am on a 6 week infusion schedule, so I had my first dose at the mid-point, i.e. 3 weeks. I found it just like any other shot and had no reaction at all. Well, my left arm was sore for 48 hours, so if you sleep on your side, have it in the opposite arm. However, I wonder if I didn't \"tighten up\", and that made it worse. I wouldn't be concerned at all. Medicare doesn't pay, so it is $160 and change for each shot. When I called our local clinic, they said the shots are are only given at one of the large drug store chains, i.e. CVS. Also, it is so popular, there seems to be a supply issue, so I'd definitely call first. Good luck!",

My walking has deteriorated though and my neuro suggested starting Rituxan (early version of Ocrevus). I've had three doses so far. I also had shingles (first and only time) during the fingolimod clinical trial. I don't want to get shingles again, but I certainly don't want to have an MS relapse either.\nAfter a lot of looking, I found this article that on pubmed that was published in Jan 2019: Vaccination Guidelines for Patients With Immune-Mediated Disorders on Immunosuppressive Therapies. It seemed to be the most researched advice I've found.\nAmong their recommendations was:\n\"Statement 2c: In patients with immune-mediated diseases treated with rituximab who require optimal vaccine immunogenicity, we recommend that immunization be deferred to ⩾5 months after the last dose and at least 4 weeks prior to the subsequent dose of rituximab.\nStrong recommendation; low-level evidence.\"\nTo read the entire study google \"pubmed PMC6330697\".\nI'm due for my fourth Rituximab dose in mid-August, so I guess I could get a dose now and another in January 2020. You have me a little worried, though. I don't want to get shingles again, but I certainly don't want to have an MS relapse either.",

    "Post" : "Low Dose Naltrexone for Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis\nA Retrospective Chart Review of Safety and Tolerability\nJournal of Clinical Psychopharmacology • Volume 35, Number 5, October 2015 www.psychopharmacology.com 609\nCopyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.\n“Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that afflicts 400,000 people in the United States and more than 4 million individuals worldwide…\nThree clinical trials of LDN in MS have been conducted and report that LDN increases the quality of life of MS patients.\nCree et al concluded from a trial… LDN daily was a safe therapy that improved quality of life, whereas Sharafaddinzadeh et al reported safety after 17 weeks of treatment and recommended that longer trials be conducted to evaluate efficacy. Gironi et al studied primary progressive MS patients treated with LDN for 6 months and reported increased endogenous opioid levels in the patients and improved MS.\nThe LDN treatment of patients with other autoimmune diseases including Crohn's disease and fibromyalgia has demonstrated safety and efficacy of the therapy.\nA major symptom of MS is fatigue, which is one of the many characteristics that patients seek to alleviate. Improvement in fatigue was cited in these clinical studies after LDN therapy, which suggests that there is a potential link between upregulated endogenous opioid systems and fatigue.\nTo determine the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of LDN on fatigue, a retrospective analysis of MS patients prescribed LDN (3.5 mg orally, once daily) by physicians in the Department of Neurology at The Penn State Hershey Medical Center was undertaken… LDN was not prescribed to patients receiving daily chronic opioid medications. All patients were given the option of receiving LDN with the understanding that medication could be stopped if they experienced side effects.\nSome patients already receiving disease-modifying therapy (DMT) when started on LDN continued the standard DMT along with adjunctive LDN. Evidence of major drug interactions was monitored but no interactions were reported.\nThe medical records of 215 MS patients, aged 18 to 65 years, seen in the MS clinic for a 7-year period (January 01, 2005 to May 31, 2012) and prescribed 3.5 mg LDN, orally, once daily, served as the study group. The LDN was provided by a licensed compounding pharmacy and cost the patients between US $30 to $50 monthly.\nPrescriptions for LDN were provided to 152 female (71%) and 63 male (29%) patients. The female to male ratio was 2.4:1 and more than 3 quarters of all patients had RRMS, a ratio similar to the prevalence cited in the United States. Clinically, 87% of the patients had RRMS and 10% had secondary progressive MS, with a mean disease duration of 10 years…\nSeventy seven percent (n = 166) of patients taking LDN for any period of time did not report any side effects. Six percent of the patients had insomnia, whereas 5% of the patients had excessive dreams. There was no evidence of increased side effects related to other immunomodulators when combined with LDN.\nNo abnormal laboratory results were noted. Of the 215 patients receiving LDN, 57 patients (26%) were hospitalized during the duration of this study; 48 of these patients were hospitalized for non-MS–related events such as infections. No patient was admitted to the hospital because of side effects of LDN.\nMost of the MS patients began LDN therapy because of fatigue. Nearly 60% (n = 128) of patients receiving LDN for any period of time reported a reduction in fatigue with LDN therapy.\nFifty of the 215 patients commented that LDN produced no relief from fatigue and 4 patients stated that LDN increased their fatigue levels.\nRegarding their quality of life and the perception of LDN's effects on MS, 130 patients (60%) stated that LDN stabilized or improved their disease and 75% of the patients reported improved or stabilized quality of life.\nNine patients reported that LDN reduced the quality of life, and 8% of the patients had the perception that their disease increased while on LDN but provided no details.\nIn conclusion, this chart review focused on 215 MS patients who were provided a prescription for oral LDN. The study reports that a significant number of patients found combination therapy of an immunomodulating agent and LDN to be tolerable and possibly beneficial. Some patients preferred to take LDN as a monotherapy. The LDN did not cause any unexpected side effects, and those reported were previously noted in the literature. The LDN did not potentiate the side effects of the immunomodulating therapies that the patients were receiving. Any hospitalizations in this study were related to reasons other than MS, and there were no hospitalizations due to LDN.”\nAUTHOR DISCLOSURE\nAnthony P.

All I can say is LDN is Low Dose because some doctors felt using Naltrexone 'off-label', and at a percentage of its normal dose would help their patients with many of the obnoxious symptoms of MS . The biggest drawback with using it is that you need to get it from a compounding pharmacy that fills this script, regularly ! And it may not be covered by insurance !

Sometimes the exacerbation simply needs to run it's course Steroids might resolve an exacerbation quicker, sometimes not.

    "Post" : "Dear stacey,\nI took Ampyra for a few years, and it did improve my walking - speed, coordination, and distance. Now I take a compounded version of the active ingredient, 4-ampyradine. It doesn't work quite so well, but my MS has advanced also. I got patient assistance from Acorda, the maker of Ampyra, but it has been discontinued. My medicare Plan D has a very high copay even for the new generic versions. That is why I resorted to a compounded medicine.\nThe 25-foot walk test is something my neuro does every visit. The speed is recorded. But I don't think that means that my treatments are solely limited to things that might improve such a short distance walk. The 25-foot test is a requirement for Ampyra, I understand, because that medicine doesn't work for everyone and even a little walk can reveal whether walking in general is getting any better. One third of MS patients get no result, one third get some benefit, and one third have a great improvement. I think I am in the top of the middle.\nMy walking is more fluid, and all my movements are easier and faster with the medicine. Falls are rare. Nevertheless, without taking frequent rests, I can only walk (with my walker) a block or two on a \"good\" day. I use my cane in interiors (church, restaurants, social gatherings). At home, I can coast along without any aide. If I forget to take the medicine, however, I notice all of my movements are much much worse. So I feel that it is useful.\nI hope you get enough information from a neurologist about your particular MS to assess the benefit to you. Good luck in your efforts.\nStay lifted,\nMermaid Susan",

I am sure I would not qualify for poverty level assistance, but having to pay this much for Avonex will mean no more vacations, dinners out, gift giving, etc.\nI've heard there may be foundations out there that are able to help. Any advice? Is anyone on medicare working with a foundation that can help with co pays if you're not at poverty level? I know, by contract, Biogen is not able to help medicare patients with co pays. Which really stinks.\nAny ideas out there on how to get that changed? Does contacting law makers help? Just looking for a ray of hope, I guess, for those of us on fixed incomes that would like to be able to visit grandchildren in another state every now and then.\nThanks for listening and best wishes out there to everyone in the same boat!

Under the advantage plan (HMO) I plan to enroll in, my co pay for Avonex will skyrocket for me to $6,500 per year. And, of course, I expect that will increase as the cost of the drug increases. I am sure I would not qualify for poverty level assistance, but having to pay this much for Avonex will mean no more vacations, dinners out, gift giving, etc.\nI've heard there may be foundations out there that are able to help. Any advice? Is anyone on medicare working with a foundation that can help with co pays if you're not at poverty level? I know, by contract, Biogen is not able to help medicare patients with co pays. Which really stinks.\nAny ideas out there on how to get that changed? Does contacting law makers help? Just looking for a ray of hope, I guess, for those of us on fixed incomes that would like to be able to visit grandchildren in another state every now and then.\nThanks for listening and best wishes out there to everyone in the same boat! I feel your pain.\n** Moderator's note - Post broken into paragraphs for easier reading. Many people with MS have visual difficulties that prevent them from reading large blocks of print. **\nBiogen helped me find assistance through a fund called The Assistance Fund. I take Tecfidera and have a very small monthly copay. There are many funds available but the money runs out fast. Sometimes the pharmaceutical company can get you on a free drug program for 6 months. I believe Avonex is made by Biogen. Get in touch with them. You can get help but it is a lot of work.",

If a woman with MS has fertility problems it is due to another cause.\nWe do not need special care such as an assisted delivery due to MS. If special care is needed it is due to other complications and not MS.\nWe are very capable of having a vaginal delivery.\nEpidurals (spinal block) is best discussed with your Neurologist and OB-GYN.\nThere are no guarantees with this disease and the possibility of our children getting MS is real. There isn't a mother who has MS that doesn't worry about passing this disease on to them There is no way to prevent the possibility of passing this disease on to our children ~ except by choosing not to have children and some with MS have made this choice.\nIt is possible to have an exacerbation (relapse, attack, flare-up) during pregnancy or post-partum. Not all women do.\nBirth Control is perfectly fine to take when having MS.\nFor reliable information please talk to your Neurologist and your OB-GYN.\nThe National Multiple Sclerosis Society has a wealth of reliable information:\nhttps://www.nationalmssociety.org/Li...alth/Pregnancy\nI have 2 children both born after my diagnosis. I did not have an exacerbation during pregnancy or post-partum. Both deliveries were C-sections but this had nothing to do with MS. The anesthesiologists would not do a spinal block (epidural) due to having MS (this may have changed by now).\nHope that helps. Take care.",

But I think I remember you posting every month when you got a dose of Tysabri—letting folks know how many infusions you’d had and how you felt at a time when there were very few long-time users.\nAnyway, once again I’m glad to hear from you. I’m 57 and also in Colorado. We might even go to the same MS Center.\nI was on Copaxone, and clearly responded well to it. But I am freaked out about brain atrophy, and I think Tysabri has a better history of normalizing it. Not sure what my neuro will suggest when I return to him next week.\nDo you have any insight into how you are doing with regard to brain volume? I had my first MRI that measured it when they found the 4 lesions last week. I have a low EDSS, but my gray matter looks pretty ragged.",

I'm now at every 49 days and have noticed no difference at all...other than I finally have my life back.\nI started the move with my old neurologist, but she moved and now I'm seeing her PA. She wasn't too thrilled but agreed to every 6 weeks BUT NO MORE! Yeah, right. However, six months later when I went in and was prepared to present my case for every 7 weeks, she was all for it.

    "Post" : "Brain atrophy is a critically important factor when considering a DMT because brain atrophy correlates with disability, as the study at the bottom demonstrates.\nBut first, there was a helpful post today on brain atrophy at this MS site…\nBeyond NEDA\nhttps://multiple-sclerosis-research....1/beyond-neda/\nQuote, “ A patient of mine, who I have been looking after now for over 11 years, asked me in clinic a few weeks ago why despite being NEDA for 6 years, on a highly effective maintenance DMT (fingolimod), has she gone from being able to run 5-10 km to needing a stick and barely managing to walk from the Whitechapel Underground Station to my clinic (~200m), without having to stop and rest?\nWhat this patient doesn’t know, despite no new visible T2 lesions, is that she has developed obvious, to the naked eye, progressive brain atrophy. This particular patient prompted me to write a few blog posts to try and explain what is happening to her brain…\nAn important question in relation to this patient is why do some DMTs have such a profound impact on end-organ damage markers, in particular, brain volume loss and others do not? Not all DMTs are made equal when it comes to preventing, or slowing down, brain volume loss.\nAt the top of the league table are alemtuzumab and HSCT (~0.2-0.25% loss per annum). Both these treatments are NIRTs (non-selective immune reconstitution therapies). Natalizumab is next with an annual brain volume loss in region of 0.25-0.3% per annum. Ocrelizumab comes fourth with a rate of brain volume loss of ~0.35% per annum. Fingolimod 5th at 0.4% per annum. Cladribine 6th at ~0.55% per annum and then the other runs after that.” End Quote\nThe study below shows disability correlates with brain atrophy.\nTreatment Effect on Brain Atrophy Correlates with Treatment Effect on Disability in Multiple Sclerosis\nurl\nhttps://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/aa7...544a52a997.pdf",

In a few years, looking back, doctors will view that idea as valuable as blood-letting, IMO.\nStick to your guns and you will more healthy than you would be listening to the people who have a track record of being wrong on whether to stop or continue your present DMT. God bless you!\nAnd Kris, great article on Alpha Lipoic Acid. I have taken it for many, many years w/o any problems and, of course, I believe it is helpful for the reason your article present.

    "Post" : "Hello Mable,\nWhy did Giavononni wait to tell a patient that brain loss volume leads to disability?\nI have no idea; I can only speculate. But I congratulate him for talking about it now. His website has a monthly Q & A section where that question can be asked.\nBrain atrophy as a clinical endpoint in DMT trials has only been introduced in the last few years. Before recently not much attention was given brain loss volume. Unlikely that many neuros have discussed it with their patients, unfortunately.\nHowever, going forward I believe brain atrophy will be discussed in the context of which DMT to choose; it is just now beginning to be recognized as a vitally important factor relative to disability.\nGilenya is better at reducing brain loss volume (BLV) than most DMTs although I personally would not choose Gilenya if I had MS. But the particular patient mentioned was NEDA on it, Mable, so for her it was/is effective.\nAll the other DMTs for MS are worse than Gilenya in reducing BLV except those Giavononni listed … HSCT and Lemtrada 0.2-0.25%, Tysabri 0.25-0.3%, Ocrevus 0.35%, Gilenya at 0.4%.\nSo, what should this patient on Gilenya be taking instead of Gilenya? That is a tough question because she is NEDA on it and her response to the others cannot be precisely predicted. With DMTs there are patients who develop neutralizing antibodies which render a DMT useless or even counterproductive.\nHSCT is not widely available even though, IMO it is clearly the most successful DMT. Next on my list is Tysabri; not Lemtrada even though some do very, very well on Lemtrada. With Lemtrada most people (but not all) will battle significant secondary immunity problems. That is why Lemtrada gives me pause.\nWith those thoughts in mind, Tysabri would be my choice whether I was JCV positive, or negative. Before going on dose extension with Tysabri (btw, convincing the neuro literally nearly took fist-fighting; our arguments were that intense, he finally caved, learned, or something and agreed that dose extension de-risks for PML. The lesson here is that sometimes you actually have to fight or change doctors for what you are convinced of, as Linda explained in her post) and before switching to Ocrevus my spouse had received more infusions of Tysabri than anyone in the world according to her neurologist. Ocrevus is a very, very good DMT but not quite as effective as Tysabri in reducing fatigue and BLV.\nThe PML aspect often scares patients away from Tysabri when MS progression should be leading MSers toward Tysabri, IMO.\nIMO, HSCT is the best option. But if HSCT is not available, Tysabri is the next best, IMO.\nPlease keep in mind not every DMT works well for every patient.\nMy opinion is based on experience in my household and results found in DMT trial and real-world data.\nIsn’t it fun choosing a DMT? It would challenge Solomon. Choices can be narrowed down by prioritizing what is most important to an individual but it still can seem like a crap shoot.\nGood luck and certainly, you have my best wishes!\nOh, one last point… we all lose brain volume as we age. In one scientific study the BLV per year was “0.20% at the age of 35 years increasing to 0.52% at 70 years” in healthy subjects. Often, BLV in MS is listed at 0.7% and higher. So, the best DMTs get that rate at very near normal. Recall even Gilenya was at 0.4%.\nIn the near future, BLV will be used as a marker for how well a DMT is doing for a particular patient, I’m certain.",

After 8 or 9 years of no changes on MRI and no increase in physical symptoms, I stopped taking Copaxone (in my early 50's). I've been stable since. The MRIs haven't changed. My symptoms are primarily heat related and recal/short-term memory issues now.\nI took the gamble you did. You don't know that you wouldn't have had new lesions even on the med you were taking the same way I will never know if the drug I took prevented new lesions or not. The statistics speak to the group and never to an individual. We use the stats to go with the odds. But how each of us will do will be what it is.\nFWIW, the doc approved stopping the med because of my age and good MRIs.

I got my first infusion coming off a terrible Gilenya washout. Vertigo and weakness so bad I couldn’t walk. And the one week before my 6 month infusion, I was in the same state again. ( I received only one dose initially, not the usual two, so I suspect that I may have regenerated some B cells. Dr. ran blood work but didn’t check that... stay w/UCFS over Stanford )\nBut, after that, it’s been great. I still have to not overexert and all the usual stuff but I feel so much better than on Tysabri or Gilenya. It took about 9 months for me to really see dramatic improvement. And the MRIs look good so far....",

    "Post" : "Hi Emily,\nThanks for your reply. I will take all the reassurance and hope I can get. My neurologist warned me last week that it was not uncommon for relapses to occur the first 3 months, after starting Rituximab and that it usually takes a good 6 months to kick in. I will have brain and spine imaging next Friday so I will hope for the best.\nI definitely plan on staying with my UCSF neurologist. I do see a headache specialist and a sleep medicine/dysautonomia neurologist at Stanford. My cardiologist, hematologist, ENT, Neuro-Endocrinologist and nephrologist are also at Stanford. I only see neurology, rheumatology and immunology at UCSF. My neuro-opthalmologist is at PAMF but transferred from UCSF.\nI really like my UCSF neurologist but I haven't been entirely happy with the MS Clinic so far. The biggest problem is that they have no after hours or weekend coverage at all. I find that so strange, because Stanford and PAMF do. It means that when I have a new symptom that is worrisome, I have to wait for the clinic to be open, go to Urgent Care or an ER. Oh, well. I can't have everything.\nHave a good weekend.",

    "Post" : "Thanks, Koko for your response. I hope things start to get better soon, too.\nThanks, Marco. I have been evaluated for these other symptoms. Most of them are not new and I have at them at different times in the past. I had brain stem lesions in 2005 that caused the dysphagia. I always have to be careful when swallowing certain things but at times, the dysphagia worsens dramatically.\nThe left hand numbness/weakness was assessed and found not to be from a pinched nerve or carpal tunnel. It is definitely neurological and originating in the CNS, per my neuro.\nThe thunderclap headaches have been associated with new lesions for me in the past so that is why I was so certain that there was something new going on. These symptoms started up a couple weeks before Christmas so the imaging didn't occur until many weeks after. Maybe there was something new that has subsequently healed up. I guess we will never know.\nMy optic neuritis has not had a good recovery either. I saw my neuro-opthalmologist 2 weeks ago and there has only been 17% improvement and he said that he would have expected 75% by now. Both my visual field and acuity are affected.\nThat would be great if I only need one dose of Rituximab in May but I am very certain he told that it would be 2. Each dose took over 11 hours to infuse and I was having reactions left and right. One infusion day would be much simpler and easier to fit into my work schedule.\nI'll keep you posted on any interesting changes, good or bad. Keeping my fingers crossed for only good things, moving forward.\nThanks!",

I think the key to reducing my reactions is to repeat the pre-meds every 4 hours while the infusion is going. It seems they do a great job of getting me pre-medicated and then we hit the 4th or 5th hour of the infusion and bingo...... I have a reaction. The plan for the next infusions will be to be pro-active rather than reactive. Going slow and steady is also critical with me.\nBest, Polopuppy",

    "Post" : "I was diagnosed in September and it has been a fight with the insurance companies to get me started on treatment. I ended up switching health insurance carriers November 1st and they outright denied brand name Copaxone. They approved the generic medication but my copay is a couple hundred dollars a month. This is a huge hardship as I have been on temporary disability since October. As of right now, I can pay the copay but it will use up my families safety net each month.\nI've always said that I would never drain my family financially over health issues. This is something I had decided at a relatively young age and I still feel that way now.\nI feel conflicted to start medication as I know it will cost more down the line if I don't try to slow down the progression or limit amount of disability I will accumulate if I don't start a DMD. But it still feels selfish to put a financial hardship on my husband and kids that they don't deserve.\nI called Mylan and found out that their copay assistance does not apply to residents of California. I don't know why but this is a huge barrier as to whether or not I pick up the medication next week. Have any of you been in a situation where you weren't eligible for copay assistance although you really needed it?\nI don't want to go through the hassle of having my neurologist order new medication after new medication just to see which one I can afford. I also decided on Copaxone as it has the least amount of side effects and is the safest. I will not consider a DMD that lowers the immune system as I plan to go back to work and I am exposed to sick patients all day in my career. I am also unwilling to risk PML, so medications such as Tysabri are out of the question.\nAny advice? For those who chose to forego using a DMD, did you ever regret it?",

    "Post" : "Hey IntoDust,\nIn California there is a LAW that no monthly prescription copay can be more than $250. That is probably why there is no $0 copay program for Copaxone in California, because you receive it as a monthly prescription and the copay cost isn't totally prohibitive. Your Explanation of Benefits should show prescriptions capped at $250 a month. That's still not cheap, but it's NOT 20% of $6,000 bucks per month either!\nFrom past reading I think you and I are in similar situations with maintaining our own private insurance. I did extensive research on the above, because initially I was prescribed Copaxone. But in the end we went with something a little stronger due to evidence of past disease activity on my spine (that which on you do not want to go...).\nOtherwise it's perfectly reasonable to put your neurologist's office through the paces in terms of finding out which DMT you could get funding for. They are probably fairly used to dealing with patients having insurance issues and would like to see you on treatment. That's part of their job, actually!\nRegarding going on a DMT or not, this guy pretty much convinced me there's no point in gambling if I don't have to:\nhttps://activemsers.blogspot.com/201...arguments.html",

How appropriate that you bring it to my attention again.\nThank you for pointing out the copay cap in California. I think it's interesting that when I was speaking to Shared Solutions in the past when I was waiting for authorization from my PCP's medical group to start brand name Copaxone, there was copay assistance available and I would have gotten the medication for free. I understand the need to put a cap on copays, I really do, but for some families $250 a month is cost prohibitive - especially when a lot of us in California are \"house poor\" due to ever increasing rent and housing prices.\nI'm just very overwhelmed and I only have until next week to pick up the medication or the pharmacy will send it back to the manufacturer. If I could just get through Christmas and my next neurologist appointment it would be easier as those are two huge expenses.\nAnd to top it all off, Mylan hasn't even reached out to me to offer to send a nurse out to teach me how to self inject. Shared Solutions had the nurse contact me the day they got the order. I work in the medical field but I have no experience in injecting myself, let alone with an auto injector.\nI'm feeling very overwhelmed right now and I feel... lost I guess.

People with MS should use the inactivated flu vaccine and avoid the live, attenuated vaccine (nasal spray).\nA high-dose inactivated flu vaccine (Fluzone High-Dose) is available for people over age 65. The Centers for Disease Control does not specifically recommend the high-dose vaccine for people over age 65 and the high-dose vaccine has not been studied in people with MS of any age.

This is what I have found that we should stay with the regular one. Comments will be very appreciated Thank you, I hope everyone has been well. Tortis\nInformation about Specific Vaccines\n2018-2019 Injectable Seasonal Flu Vaccine\nThe composition of U.Sl influenza (flu) vaccines is reviewed annually by the Centers for Disease Control and updated to match circulating flu viruses.\nThe 2018-19 inactivated seasonal flu immunization is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for everyone over 6 months of age. The seasonal flu vaccine has been studied extensively in people with MS and is considered quite safe, regardless of the disease-modifying therapy they are taking. People with MS should use the inactivated flu vaccine and avoid the live, attenuated vaccine (nasal spray).\nA high-dose inactivated flu vaccine (Fluzone High-Dose) is available for people over age 65. The Centers for Disease Control does not specifically recommend the high-dose vaccine for people over age 65 and the high-dose vaccine has not been studied in people with MS of any age. For these reasons, the National MS Society continues to support influenza vaccination (flu shots) for people with MS but recommends that only the standard dose be used. If additional data for Fluzone High-Dose in MS patients become available, the recommendation may be revised.\nTo learn more about the 2018-2019 seasonal flu vaccine, please visit the CDC website.\nI’ve taken the high dose flu vaccine for the past two years. I’ve had no issues. Since I’m on Tysabri with an extended schedule, I make sure I get the shot midway between infusions.",

In one series, there were 4 total cases in rheumatoid arthritis treated with rituxan out of 129,000 exposed, suggesting risk of ~1/25,000; 1 of these 4 cases was with no biologic and minimal immunosuppressive therapy.\nSource: “Rituximab-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in rheumatoid arthritis JAMA Neurology, “09/14/2011 Clifford DB et al.\nReply\nDr. Gavin Giovannoni Tuesday, December 16, 2014 10:16:00 am\nThanks for this. I sat on an PML advisory board several years ago and we reviewed all the PML cases linked to rituximab; we didn't find a single case on monotherapy. The one case referred to here on minimal immunosuppressive therapy had been on steroids. The take home message is that the risk of PML on rituximab is very low; the caveat being carryover PML from natalizumab. I think rituximab, and by inference ocrelizumab and other anti-CD20 therapies, will be a relatively safe drugs to transition onto from natalizumab.\"\nhttp://multiple-sclerosis-research.b...l#comment-form",

    "Post" : "This is a very, very interesting thread, especially for pwMS in the USA.\nIf your neuro is considering Rituxan rather than Ocrevus he/she is absolutely brilliant, IMHO.\nWhy?\nBecause Ocrevus and Rituxan are very, very similar. Both are good meds for MS. Ocrevus was developed because the patent ran out on Rituxan. Ocrevus is tweaked Rituxan. Tweaked, primarily to get a new patent and charge at least 10x what Rituxan costs.\nSince they are quite similar why do I think Rituxan is better?\nBecause the dose and the frequency of infusions can be individually tailored. The neuro does not have to give you a set dosage nor does he have to give it to you every six months as with Ocrevus. That fact might save your life if the spike in cancer rates seen during Ocrevus trials turns out to be an actual risk in real world use of Ocrevus. We don’t know, yet. However, we do know that Ocrevus keeps working at least 18 months after the last infusions during trials.\nHere is a link proving that statement...\nhttps://www.ebiomedicine.com/article...17)30045-2/pdf\nClick the link and look at the chart on page 6. It shows that Ocrevus continued providing protection 18 months after no more infusions were received.\nClearly, Ocrevus every six months could be too much for some people. Especially if the cancer risk plays out. The cells being depleted by Ocrevus are needed to fight off cancer. So, if you over-deplete them, you may put yourself at an increased risk of cancer. Please understand Ocrevus is new so we have to wait to know for sure if there will be an increase of cancer seen using Ocrevus.\nTo me, it makes sense that it would, although it may take years to prove.\nSo, what would an excellent clinician do? I think he would give Rituxan only as often as his patient required. That means if there are no new or enhancing lesions or no new significant clinical signs of MS progression then you may not need an infusion every six months. And, if you get infusions you don’t need why put yourself at risk of cancer or any other health issue which may arise from getting more of an immune suppressing medicine than you need to control MS?\nIMO, any doctor using Rituxan rather than Ocrevus is on top of all of this and far out in front of it. I envy anyone who has such a doctor.\nMost neuros are going to infuse a person with MS with 600mg of Ocrevus every six months, period, end of discussion. That’s what the FDA approved and, by God (my sincere apologies, no offense is intended) 600mg every six months is what you are going to get even if it kills you; and for some it may… if an increased cancer risk is demonstrated infusing Ocrevus every six months.\nYes, I believe Rituxan is a better option than Ocrevus because I believe a neuro can more easily adjust the dosage and frequency with Rituxan. If you achieve NEDA (No Evidence of Disease Activity) with Rituxan your neuro is free NOT to infuse you until and unless you need it.\nIts just as likely to achieve NEDA with Ocrevus but the difference is you are going to keep getting it every six months.\nWith Ocrevus a person with MS will get 600mg every six months no matter if you weigh 90 lbs. or 300 lbs. and regardless of the individual variance in B-cell depletion even though that depletion may be adversely affecting health issues outside of MS.\nIMHO, it will be YEARS before this situation is recognized and adjustments made to accommodate it, if ever. Change happens slowly.\nI pounded the table in heated discussion with my spouse’s neuro for an entire year before he finally agreed to extend time between doses of Tysabri to reduce PML risk. Based on that experience, I can predict it will be pure hell for any patient trying to alter the dose or frequency of Ocrevus. It is usually futile and can be extremely stressful arguing with a neurologist even when it is your life that is at stake.\nIMHO, what makes Rituxan a FAR superior medicine to Ocrevus is that the dose and frequency of infusions can be adjusted individually as required.\nIf your neurologist is using Rituxan rather than Ocrevus you have an excellent neurologist, IMO.\nBTW, one person said their insurance did not approve Rituxan. Wow, insurance ought to compare the cost of those two meds if they want to save a ton of money. Rituxan is far less expensive.",

Thank You!\nBest wishes on the appointment today!",

    "Post" : "Marco,\nI'm glad you are having wonderful success with rituximab! Most pwMS seem to do very well on it. There is great wisdom in waiting a few years to see how Ocrevus plays out when someone is already using a highly effective DMT.\nYou mentioned that you are JCV+ so you don't see Tysabri as a long term medication for you. Also, that MS rebound coming off Tysabri is concerning. Those are both solid statements which I fully understand. Today, I'm not going to address the rebound issue although I may in the future.\nBut I do have to say something about being JCV+ on Tysabri because it may save a life; it may save someone and their family from a needless and horrible tragedy.\nI cannot stress often enough nor in enough threads that extending the weeks between doses of Tysabri beyond the standard 4 week infusion saves lives in those who are JCV+. Going 5, 6, 7, or 8 weeks between infusions has cut the number of PML cases to ZERO since late 2013 in those on dose extension.\nIn the fall of 2015, Ryerson reported no cases of PML in hundreds of Tysabri patients doing extended dosing. She reported zero cases of PML and since then have been no reports of a single case of PML in those who are JCV+ and going 5, 6, 7, or 8 weeks between infusions.\nI am going to keep shouting that out until every person on Tysabri knows it. And, their doctors, too.\nI simple cannot live in peace knowing that some MSers will get PML, 23% of them will die from PML, and some like the poor, poor dear man who posted here that his wife had not spoken and two years and may never again because she got PML on Tysabri.\nThere is no justification for anyone JCV+ to be on 4 week dosing!\nQuote...\"Our prior retrospective work found that extending the dose up to 8 weeks did not negatively affect the medication’s efficacy in a retrospective review of 2,000 patients in 6 MS Centers across the US.\"\nQuote, \"Our new study, carried out in collaboration with Biogen and academic partners presented at ACTRIMS in San Diego, CA... adds an important caveat to known PML risk in natalizumab users. According to the comprehensive analysis of TOUCH database, which includes all natalizumab users in the Unites States, the risk of PML is very significantly lower in JCV Antibody positive patients whose natalizumab infusions have been extended from 4 weeks to 5-12 weeks...\nQUOTE \"… there were no PML cases among 815 patients who met the inclusion criteria as compared to 96 cases noted in standard interval group (comprised of 23,168 patients).\"\n\"The large risk reduction seen with extending natalizumab infusions by just 2 weeks is potentially practice-changing since it could give neurologists an opportunity to prescribe a highly efficacious medication in a safer way.\"\nhttp://multiple-sclerosis-research.b...sing.html#more\nDear God in Heaven, please make this known to every person on Tysabri and every doctor prescribing it.",

Being more informed with legit sources of information will definitely help me with my confidence in speaking to him about it.\nThe decision for me to start taking any kind of medication was hard enough and I like the idea of limiting the amount of tysabri that is being infused into me!

Why take more of a medicine than you need to maintain NEDA?\nI know all too well what speaking to a neurologist is like on an issue such as dose extension! You have my deepest empathy.\nWhat I would recommend is... doing what you are... gather info, get familiar with the issue, and then write out your thoughts and reasons on why you would like to extend time between infusions.\nI will post some resource links for you in the Tysabri thread and just call it Resources for Dose Extension. It will take a couple of days before I can get to it but I look forward to doing so!\nYou are completely on the right track! A friend emailed me today ... \"I am quite concerned about long-term B-cell depletion in general. It bothers me that they don't really understand the actual mechanism of MS and in some sense are hitting it with a sledgehammer... while I don't fault the doctors, the treatments we are taking have a profound but not always well understood effect on our immune system.\"\nWell said!\nEven though you are JCV- at this point, it would not be unusual for you to convert to positive. But even if you do, you can go on dose extension and greatly decrease your risk of developing PML, and if the trend of no cases holds... well, even better.\nLastly, people on Tysabri convert from negative to positive about 10 times faster than the general population according to one study. Therefore, it is logical to believe if you were less saturated with Tysabri, as you would be on dose extension, it is probable that people on Tysabri would convert from negative to positive less frequently. Yes, IMO, you would be less likely to convert to positive. That is only my opinion.\nAs time goes on data will be mined to find if that is the case, if you want to wait 10 years on it is another matter.\nGo with what makes sense to you. You will feel better about yourself and you will live better, too! And likely be a lot healthier!\nIt's your life, Sara. Not your doctor's. He works for you; you may have to look for a different one. You are Canadian? If so, I don't know how you go about that.\nWhat I can say is that you are on the right track in cutting back on Tysabri and those on Ocrevus and rituximab ought to be aware that cutting back on depleting B-cells is a great idea because under certain unfortunate circumstances (cancer being one) you will need those cells fighting for you.\nThe less we alter our immune systems with MS under control the better health we will enjoy. I don't believe even old school doctors can question that statement or the reasoning behind it.\nDear Moderators, please edit my previous post, won't you? Thank you! I meant to say\nThere is NO justification for anyone JCV+ to be on 4 week dosing!",

    "Post" : "Hello,\nSuch an interesting appointment and post, ru4cats! Wow, neurologists can be so slow to grasp something but when they do its like switching on a light. Boom! Well, of course, infusing every 8 weeks on Tysabri is a “no-brainer”. Dear God, the argument and stress that would have saved me 5 years ago!\nThe reason it is now a \"no brainer\" is because PML is de-risked and coverage is still adequate to keep MS at bay. But please keep this in mind… if you go to 8 weeks and you get a new lesion or enhancing old lesion, you would want to go to 7 weeks between infusions. I have a friend who did just that and is now on a 7-week schedule.\nTysabri came back onto the market in early 2006. Some patients went on dose extension in 2013. Tragically, it took 5 years and Ryerson’s research data to finally get the life-saving practice of dose extension widely accepted; at least in those who are JCV+.\nI hope Sarabeach and others who are JCV- will not have to play hell with hard-headed neuros to go to a 6-week schedule. A 6-week schedule in those who are JCV- will delay or prevent conversion, I firmly believe. It makes just as much sense to believe that as it does to believe dose extension de-risks for PML… the same principles apply.\nUnfortunately, it could easily take 5 more years to collect and analyze data to prove it, just as it did with dose extension so good luck talking to your neuro. You will have to be firm, willing to argue, willing to make your doctor mad… all fun, right? Seriously, I am so, so sorry if that is the sad situation anyone has to face. But I’d rather prepare you for battle than pretend you won’t have one.\nBiogen makes money from infusions so Biogen is not going to go along with extending dose in those JCV-. That is the reality… you are fighting Biogen’s push-back. Nothing else can explain why any thinking neuro would not immediately agree to 6-week infusions for even his JCV negative patients, IMO.\nSarabeach, good luck, girl! I know you can and will get this done. If he does not agree to 6-week infusions keep hammering every appointment. YOU ARE RIGHT! That gives you great strength. He would put you on 6-weeks in a heartbeat if you were JCV+ and at the rate of conversion you will get there someday, anyway. He will give in if you keep trying. Its your life. Your will is stronger than his; you will win if you don’t give up! What do they say? Fight like a girl! Women are absolutely tenacious!\nRu4cats! I am happy for the great appointment you had, Chris! And btw, your post to the 21-year-old girl was one of the best I’ve ever read. Well done!\nHello Medina69,\nYou live in Sweden? I should have said that if you are in the US you are going to get 600mg of Ocrevus every 6 months. Doctors here are extremely reluctant to do anything outside established protocols because they get sued so often. It may be altogether different there. My guess is that your doctors may have more wiggle room and they could adjust dose as needed. I bet so. Sweden was where the dose extension theory originated for Tysabri. Someone mining your national health data noticed lighter weight people got PML more than heavier people. And the theory that Tysabri concentration was less in heavier people to explain it. Turned out to be true… decrease the concentration and MS is still in check and PML is de-risked. Thank you, Sweden,!!!!!!!!\nHello murrayms,\nWow, they really loaded you with rituximab! They must have wanted to really get on top of the situation with MS and I bet it worked, too. If infected B-cells are driving MS and they wiped them out, I bet that largely halted your MS progression. You mentioned your CD19 was near zero. Likely, your CD20 was very low, also. Both of those are types of b-cells.\nYou were on Rituxan then they switched you to Ocrevus. You will do well on it, also. They both have almost the identical effect in depleting those types of cells.\nOff label, and that is how rituximab is being used in MS, it seems as though neuros are more willing or more free to adjust dose and number of infusions.\nWhy your neuro switched can only be guessed but it could be a liability issue, I suppose, or money. Ocrevus is approved for MS; rituximab is not.\nBack to your point about b-cell depletion… what need is there to get an infusion of a b-cell depleter, either Ocrevus or rituximab, if you are already at zero or very, very low? That is exactly what I mean by adjusting the dose and frequency of infusions. Why get more than you need and potentially put yourself at a safety risk? Some people may need a lot to zero out those b-cells but some surely do not. Why suppress your immune system more than necessary if MS is subdued? Remember Tysabri and how dangerous it was to do that.\nThe best doctors, IMO, will test for depleted b-cells and make adjustments in dose and frequency but I’m afraid most won’t. Too busy seeing patients, I suppose.\nWe see how many years it took with Tysabri for doctors to stubbornly, finally recognize that too much Tysabri was killing patients and make adjustments in dose and frequency.\nOne has to wonder if something similar may happen with Ocrevus if the cancer risk plays out. There may be no increased cancer risk with Ocrevus; we have to wait on data! Importantly, Ocrevus has little PML concern so the situation is not nearly the same as with Tysabri.\nOcrevus and rituximab is selective about the b-cells they deplete. We want b-cells for proper immune function... we want depletion to the point of controlling MS but not destroying decent immune function... that is wonderful balance we hope to achieve.\nTysabri seems to have gotten there in achieving that balance.\nOf course, Tysabri does not wipe out b-cells; it only prevents them from crossing the blood-brain barrier.\nOcrevus is still too new to achieve such nuance in dose or frequency. That is why, IMO, rituximab is a good option… off-label, in the USA anyway, I think it is easier to adjust than it will be with Ocrevus, Sure, Ocrevus can be adjusted but will they? Likely not. I believe doctors will be as pig-headed with it as they were with Tysabri for years.\nHopefully, doctors are different in Sweden… or perhaps it would be better to say they have more freedom from lawsuits and can practice more freely to accommodate individual patient’s needs.\nBest wishes!",

    "Post" : "High praise, Myoak! Thanks! I really need to restrain myself when I see recommendations of Copaxone, Rebif, even Tecfidera, hence \"hair on fire\". I was so lucky to have a progressive neurologist in little old Montana back in 2010 who got me on Tysabri as my first medication. I watched her get other 20 somethings on the medication, and their MS just seemed to disappear. They are leading completely normal lives with just one little infusion every 28 days; you would never guess they had MS. I'm now really a proponent of the \"hit it with a hammer\" philosophy and spread the word far and wide. I'm joined a FB group for Tysabri and really promote it there, along with the extended infusion's protocol, once someone is stabilized on the medication.\nI actually called Biogen and asked about extended infusions. All they said was their protocol was every 28 days, but it was up to my doctor. Thankfully, they've never questioned it. My neurologist is comfortable putting me in charge of my infusion schedule of 6 or 7 weeks. Since I have a 110 round mile trip for each one, this flexibility really helps in the dead of winter. I don't know that I even need medication at my age, but stopping is just one risk that isn't worth it to me.\nI asked whether she thought Rituxin would ever be approved for MS, and no surprise she said no; Big Pharma strikes again.\nI love your addition of information on extended infusions. I've bookmarked the information and will share with others.\nKris",

    "Post" : "Hi Kris,\nApologizes for misspelling your name before.\nYou are so right about being aggressive early on in MS treatment. We both know several people on Tysabri whose disease progression halted and they seem largely unaffected by the medicine or the disease. No, Tysabri does not work that well for everyone. But for the majority (and each one I know personally), it seems to.\nOcrevus and Rituxan are very good medicines for MS, too. What I see in this household switching from Tysabri to Ocrevus is more fatigue and more MS symptoms. Of course, response varies individually, as always. Some people may do better on Ocrevus than Tysabri, if so, we need to hear from them. I think those who switch should give it a year and then speak up about their experience, or what they have observed. That is one of the great values of a site like this.\nAbsolutely, your voice is so important. People contemplating going on a DMT need to know what your experience is with Tysabri and what you have observed in others.\nWith expanding acceptance of dose extension as a method to de-risk for PML in those JCV+ using Tysabri I hope Tysabri will be more thoroughly considered by those choosing a DMT.\nI agree with you that choices like Copaxone, Rebif, Tecfidera and most others commonly offered the newly diagnosed are going to be hugely disappointing in the long run if irreversible damage occurs while taking those meds rather than a highly effective one like Tysabri.\nI agree with you... attack MS early and aggressively. The wait and see what happens is last century's bad idea in neurology. We did that and it was a bad idea. JMHO.",

    "Post" : "Sorry I posted this first in the \"Tysabri\" sub section but I think it fits better in the general \"Medicaton & Treatment\" section! Sorry for double posting.\nHello,\nI am new to this forum. I am 28 years old, female, my MS was diagnosed 9 years ago. My first relapse was numbness/sensatory problems in both legs, it recovered. The first five years I had rebif and avonex and in that period I had one relapse with balance problems, I fully recovered.\nIn the past 4 years I took tecfidera. First two years there were no relapses and no new MRI activity. After a heavy coughing infection I got one light relapse in 2017 with one new 3mm lesione.\nBut this year I suddenly had two relapses, stiffness in my leg and a few weeks later in my hand. It was quite scary because I was almost unable to use the hand for around two weeks. Both fully recovered with prednisolone influsions.\nNow the doctors say I should go on Tysabri as my JCV is negative. But the weird thing is, my new MRIs both spinal and brain do not show any new lesions and no activitiy. The brain MRI shows no new lesions since last year. In the year before I had that one 3mm lesione that I mentioned above.\nIn the spine, they didn't even see anything new since 2009! I dont really get it as my relapses were relatively strong at least from what I had experienced before.\nI also have to say that this year I had the most stressful period of my life because I am in the finishing period of my PhD. But this will be over in a few weeks.\nDo you think I should start Tysabri now or have another MRI in a few months and see if I stabilize once the stress is over?\nI am JCV negative, so the PML would not be an issue. However, due to my job I was always spending longer periods abroad working in different institutes (sometimes three months, sometimes a year). With Tecfidera I could always take it with me but Tysabri I have to get here, I guess (Germany). I know it is available in many countries, but I think my insurance wouldn't cover it abroad.\nOf course, health is more important, and I am willing to change my lifestyle eben though I loved longer stays abroad. But as I understood, shorter travels up to 4 weeks will still be possible, right?\nI am now feeling completely free of symptoms, I excercise, take Vit D and my tecfidera. But of course, the relapses earlier this year worried me. On the other hand, the MRI was quiet and the very specific dissertation-related stress will be over soon.\nI find that such a difficult decision to make. I am worried about the rebound. Once I stop Tysabri I will have to go on a (probably stronger) medication immediately as far as I understood.\nMe and my partner also want to have children in the coming years. My neuro said Tydabri would not be a bad option then since there is a lot of experience on tysabri patients + pregnancy.\nDifficult decision Maybe someone can give me some ideas about what you think.\nThank you!",

    "Post" : "Hello StickyRice!\nI have been meaning to write but have been terribly busy; I have been thinking about you much, though.\nFirst, your doctors are concerned about the increased MS activity. Yes, stress can be a contributor but their concern goes beyond stress and they want to get a handle on MS progression.\nOne of your concerns is receiving infusions out of country. Possibly you could work with your supplier and they may be able to ship it to an infusion center out of country. As long as it is kept cool in a well insulated container, shipped, and arrived still cool, there would be no problem. Also, as others have pointed out, extending dose past 4 weeks is prudent for many. My wife got infusions every 8 weeks and was just fine. But I have no idea what leeway doctors have in Germany where you live.\nMany times when someone is JCV- they remain on a 4-week infusion schedule. However, I think that is foolish for those who are doing well enough to extend time between doses. Why? For an exceedingly important reason... it is well established that people on Tysabri convert from negative to positive faster than the general population. So, the fact that some people who are JCV neg extend time between doses may keep them from turning positive and they can live w/o fear of PML. No JCV = no PML.\nWhy Tysabri? I can honestly say that the years my spouse was on Tysabri were years when no one could even tell she had MS. Last year she switched to Ocrevus and now has more fatigue. Her energy level has changed, she sleeps more and gets tired more easily.\nYou are young and just beginning a career. You need energy to work. Tysabri, of ALL the MS DMTs provides the best opportunity for having the highest level of energy. You should be able to find that info on your own but I can follow that up, if you wish. Bart's MS Blog is a great source of MS info, btw.\nAlso, you can find a study on Tysabri and pregnancies posted in the Tysabri thread.\nIMO, the best chance you have for the most normal life possible is with Tysabri. My wife was on it from 2002 until 2017; it was taken off the market for one year when PML was discovered. Many people at this site have been on Tysabri a long, long time and done exceedingly well. Not everyone has success with it but many do. I agree with ru2cats, it is the best MS medicine available right now. JMHO.\nBest Wishes!!!! You will do well!",

    "Post" : "Hello StickyRice,\nThe following 3 titles involving Tysabri from the 2018 ECTRIMS beginning Oct 10 in Berlin may be relevant to your question about starting Tysabri or waiting. I list only the title and a very small amount of content for the sake of brevity. The titles are in bold. Plus, I highlighted a few lines in bold to draw your attention to them.\n1. Long-term effectiveness of natalizumab in multiple sclerosis: a 10-year nationwide prospective cohort study\nAbstract: P881\nConclusions: Natalizumab was associated with reduced disability progression rate in relapsing-onset MS with even significantly higher effectiveness when initiated early.\n2. Natalizumab is associated with no evidence of disease activity and improved cognitive function and health-related quality of life in anti-JC virus seronegative patients with early relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: a 3-year analysis of STRIVE\nAbstract: P891\nConclusions: In patients with early RRMS, natalizumab treatment over 3 years was associated with NEDA maintenance and improved cognitive and HRQoL (health related quality of life) outcomes. These results are consistent with previous work showing natalizumab's effectiveness when initiated early in the RRMS disease course.\n3. Early treatment with Natalizumab prevents cortical gray matter atrophy: a two-year prospective study in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients\nAbstract: P584\nType: Poster Sessions\nAbstract Category: Therapy - Neuroprotection and Repair\nObjectives: To assess longitudinal effects of Natalizumab… on cortical gray matter thickness and cognitive performance in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients.\nMethods: A longitudinal prospective study. RRMS patients underwent 3.0T 3D high resolution brain MRI (Signa, GE) examination and comprehensive computerized cognitive assessment before initiation of Natalizumab and at 2 years of treatment, along with neurological assessments once every 3 months. FreeSurfer 5.3 was applied to obtain brain morphometrics and to perform paired, longitudinal, cortical thickness analyses.\nResults: Sixty RRMS patients, 44 Females, 16 Males, age 36.3 ± 9.3 years, disease duration 8.4 ± 6.0 years, expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score 2.6 ± 1.5, were included. Following 2 years of Natalizumab treatment… Patients who started Natalizumab treatment early (≤7.5 years from onset) exhibited no cortical gray matter atrophy (CGMA) while those who initiated the treatment late (>7.5 years from onset) exhibited significant CGMA in five focal clusters on the right hemisphere and in one cluster in the left hemisphere, p< 0.02. Under 2 years of Natalizumab treatment cognitive performance was stable with significant improvement in information processing speed score (+3.7%, p=0.011).\nConclusions: We identified an early therapeutic window that is important to prevent CGMA in Natalizumab treated RRMS patients.",

Cymbalta did nothing for my leg pains but made me a zombie. Been one for over a year. He wrote me a script for 100mg Zoloft (I was on 50 before, all in my chart there). Told me to stop Cymbalta right away and start Zoloft in morning.\nAlso wrote me amitriptyline to take at night INSTEAD of my well working Ambien. (well established for me that is what only works without side effects or sluggish next day.\nNow for issues, stopped amitriptyline after 3 night and days and totally sleepiness. I knew I couldnt take rhat crap. Back to Ambien. That is fine. But been feeling not right emotionally, head inside feels weird.

Antidepressants are very tricky to manage and cutting off cold turkey and jumping on board with a new one can be very hard on your body. In the long run it might be the best scenario for you, but the transition period might be rough. I suggest you go back to the doctor you just saw to tell him how things are going. You clearly know when something works and when it doesn't. If this doctor isn't willing to work with you, find another one.\nI don't know anything about Aubagio, but if you don't feel like it isn't working, it is your neuro's responsibility to try other things and perhaps that means a different dosage. Maybe call the neuro's office and ask to be put on a cancellation list and tell them that your medication needs to be evaluated.\nHave you had an MRI recently?",

    "Post" : "Hi scopus.\nEach person reacts to medications differently. I was on and off Baclofen several times and usually took it as needed. A few years ago I needed Baclofen on a regular basis. Initially I was tired until my body adjusted to the dosage.\nAfter time I was tired constantly to the point Narcolepsy was suspected. Baclofen really wasn't helpful so my Neurologist switched my prescription to Zanaflex and I went off Baclofen. Once Baclofen was out of my system I no longer feel asleep randomly nor was I tired all the time.\nIt was determined I did not have Narcolepsy but a side effect of Baclofen. Muscle relaxers can help spasticity but they can come with some side effects that can affect your Quality Of Life (QOL).\nMy suggestion is to be very aware of a worsening of your fatigue and to let your Neurologist know. There is other muscle relaxers that can be tried that might agree with you better than Baclofen.\nExercise, gentle stretching, yoga, pilates, swimming, etc. can be beneficial for MS symptoms including Spasticity.\nTake care.",

Some people take more, some take only 1 gram per day. The way I take it at 2 grams per day is enough for a real trial of 30 days.

Not likely, IMO.\nSeriously, why on earth would you think he/she could determine the safety of something they never studied or perhaps, have read little or nothing about?\nYou have to do the homework yourself on matters outside the realm of traditional western medicine like mushrooms. You will learn more in 30 minutes than someone who hasn't spent 30 minutes researching it; like your doctor, for instance. Then he/she can ask you about it because you will be more knowledgeable.

He has made a lot of videos that I look forward to viewing.\nHe mentions \"motor fatigue\" and explains that when the body heats up from exercise, our nerves short circuit.\nI looked up the definition on the National MS Society website, and found this explanation of motor fatigue in their brochure about the different types of MS fatigue:\nMotor fatigue: A type of fatigue that occurs in muscles (most often in the legs or arms) that are not receiving adequate nerve impulses due to demyelination. These muscles may tire quickly with repeated use causing feelings of extreme weakness, and recover following a period of rest.\nThat's explains precisely the type of fatigue that I have (and the only type that I have at this time, thankfully). I don't hear the term \"motor fatigue\" used very often, but I will be sure to use it from now on, as there are several other different types of MS fatigue.\nTake Care",

The fatigue is my big issue. I tend to feel normal and do errands then clearly I did too much and feel like I went from 90% to 1% energy in 2 minutes. I try to just do the bare minimum errand wise and try not to over do it but its hard. My doctor gave me a script for Adderall but I was uncomfortable with taking that on a daily basis. I already don't sleep well due to the bladder issues being worse at night time. I found on another blog a med called Advanced Ambrotose made by Mannatech. Got it off Amazon recently, and just started it today. Worst cade it does nothing but if I could even just have a little more energy that would be great.\nMy question is, has anyone tried this med before? What was your experience with it? Did it help with any of your symptoms? Did it help with fatigue at all??\nThanks for the help!!!!",

It's possible to take a small dose a few times a day and it won't keep you awake at night. All of the medications prescribed for MS fatigue does come with side effects, some serious. In my opinion it would be better to try treatments that is prescribed by your Dr. than spending a small fortune on something a Multi-level marketing company puts out.\nDealing with MS fatigue is not easy. Sometimes the medications help, sometimes they don't and some are unable to use them. Non-medication options are rest/sleep, and exercise.

    "Post" : "Hi Storygirl,\nJust my thoughts...\nI have to say pretending to not have MS is awfully tempting to anyone faced with such complex treatments decisions!\nYou apparently have RRMS so when it is in remission pretending you don't have it is okay. But when it flares up or when a new lesion is discovered it pretty much forces a choice of one DMT or another, no matter how difficult the choice.\nYou said you have been on 4 MS meds and your neuro wants you to consider 3 more and pick one. The problem I see is that the 3 he gave you to pick from are no more effective in slowing disease activity than the first 4.\nTwo notables DMTs not on your list to pick from are Tysabri and Ocrevus. Notable because both are significantly more effective than any of the others mentioned in your post.\nAll MS meds have a unique set of risks but, perhaps, the biggest risk the less effective DMTs carry is the risk of treating MS with a med not effective enough to make a significant difference in decreasing disease activity.\nIf HSCT is not an option then Tysabri or Ocrevus are options to consider if the 4 lesser meds have not worked... and... if your MS is aggressive enough to believe the 3 other meds with similar effectiveness to the first 4 may not slow disease progression enough for you, either.\nI guess the question to ask is... if the first 4 meds were not effective, what is the basis for believing other meds of similar effectiveness would work? Is it time to consider something highly effective?\nIf so, HSCT, Tysabri, and Ocrevus are all substantially more effective compared to the DMTs mentioned in your post... Copaxone, Avonex, Tecfidera, Plegridy, Aubagio, Betaseron, or Rebif.\nYou have my empathy because treatment decisions are murderously difficult! Counsel with those who are helpful, gather the best info you can, and make a choice you can sleep with. No one has a crystal ball that can predict the future.

I wouldn't take it without the clinical trial especially because you have no proof it's actually working (I have to get 1.5 hour MRIs every check up, among other things).\nInitially, I felt tired but it went away. I've been on it for about a month and a half now and I don't really have any crazy side effects. Judging by my tired feeling, I think I started on the drug instead of the placebo.

No one can predict precisely how well the transition period from one med to another will go. You and your doctor were in agreement to go for something more effective and the future may prove that was a wise decision.\nIn the meantime please keep your doctor informed about your symptoms.\nThe problems you are experiencing now may turn out to be quite short-term and very soon things will turn for the better. Ocrevus begins having a therapeutic effect almost immediately. I'm sure you feel April 5 cannot come soon enough, bless your heart. You are in my thoughts and prayers for strength and health.

I’m SO excited to be taking a trip that doesn’t revolve around MS (doctor visit, labs, scans, etc)— just a nice weekend away!\nHowever, I wondered if anyone else has a drink or two while taking Gabapentin. I just started taking it about 2-3 weeks ago. I’m not a heavy drinker... maybe a glass of wine every month, but I would love to have a martini or maybe two glasses of wine this weekend if I felt like it. I just don’t want to experience adverse effects because of it. Is it better to skip the meds if I know I’ll be drinking with dinner? Is that negligent? Or err on the side of caution and just not drink?\nThanks for reading and offering any advice! Much appreciated, as always!",

That didn't even touch my spasticity.\nIn 1999, I had foot surgery on my right foot. That surgery set off my spasticity, especially in my right leg. While I would sit in my recliner, my right leg would spasm up to my chest.\nI got referred to a pain management dr about the baclofen pump. We discussed the pump and I felt comfortable with it. This is my disclaimer, we did not do a pump study. I am fully behind doing one.\nThere are 2 sizes of pumps. One size is 20 cc and one is 40 cc's. I have the pump that holds 40 cc's. I get my pump refill every 4 and a half months. My current dose is 119 mikagrams daily. The longest time you can go between refills is 6 months, due to the shelf life of the liquid baclofen.\nIn my experience, having my pump has allowed me to do what ever I want to do, without dealing with spasticity. I walk with a cane, drive, work, etc. I also do therapeutic horseback riding. I am very active and have had no pump issues with my activities.\nTake Care, Bob",

I have done well with it. I am still considered clinically isolated at this time as I’ve never had a relapse. Very minor change in my first MRI after diagnosis (1 new lesion on my brain) and no new lesions since that time (at diagnosis, lesions were present on my brain and spine).\nFrom the get go, I have had very little side effects in the form of flu like symptoms (maybe 3 times a year seemingly out of nowhere). I always ask my doctor at every appointment about anything new or exciting coming down the pike. He always responds (and I know in my heart)....if it ain’t broke, don’t try to fix it. So alas, I suck up the needles and carry on. And I do acknowledge that it may not even be the meds keeping me stable, but for me not taking them is not a risk I’m willing to take.\nHowever, my hand may be forced as my employer has switched prescription insurance and Rebif is no longer covered. The insurance company suggested Avonex (I KNOW I don’t want that) and Betaseron. I’ve already started the process of my neurologist sending in a preauth in the hopes that they will cover it since I’ve done so well on the Rebif for so long. That said, I’m preparing myself to possibly have to make a switch.\nAnyone have any insights into how the two meds compare? I’m curious about efficacy (my most important consideration), side effects, injection sight reactions, relapses, MRI results...anything you can offer me is greatly appreciated!",

If you ask MSWorld if anyone shares your birthday I can almost guarantee you that several people would.\nUnlike your date of birth, your disease course is unique to you.\nThere are people that never take a DMT and do well. There are also people that faithfully take DMTs and rapidly decline.\nI tend to equate DMTs like a seat belt, they don't guarantee your survival in a wreck, but they do improve your odds. Likewise, on average, our medications alter the natural course of the disease decreasing the number of lesions and flare-ups we experience.\nAt the same time, improving your health by improving your diet, sleep, physical fitness, etc is good for everyone, including MSers. We also know that and decreasing stressors, stopping smoking, etc are beneficial to MS patients. So do these things, but don't expect them to slow the natural course of the disease.\nThe more potent medications are helping many patients reach a state of No Evidence of Disease Activity (NEDA). For now, that's as good as it gets including a clean MRI. Remember that MRI technology has limits, but remains our best gauge for lesion activity. Take a look at this http://www.msdiscovery.org/news/news...more-meets-eye\nI wish you well and hope you find peace in whatever decision you make. It's certainly a personal decision and many people have elected to not use DMTs with \"success.\" Personally, I gladly take my DMT just like I faithfully buckle my seatbelt while in a vehicle.\nCan you please comment on why you are \"deathly afraid\" of possible side effects, but ok with actual new lesion activity?\nMany people take aubagio and tecfidera without any side effects. There are also a number of other options besides just those two. Have you considered getting another opinion from a different neurologist?",

    "Post" : "You asked why DMTs for those of us on them? For me it was about slowing the progression of the disease.\nI was dx with CIS, so by definition I have only had 1 attack. I have a bunch of lesions, and my CSF indicates I have all the associated proteins. There is a 20% chance this was my only attack and I would never go on to have another. However due to imaging results and my CSF, I am in the category where I have an 80% chance of developing another attack.\nAs MS is so unpredictable, you never know what the next attack will be. My current one is fairly mild as far as attacks go but what if the next one is not? What if the next one renders me unable to move a leg? Or a foot? or an arm? Or my vision? The science is pretty strong that the most of the DMTs, especially the current generation (the oral ones) do really well at preventing further progression.\nThe science backs the fact that at this stage, they are the most effective. They can't make things better but they can make it from getting worse. With me having very little progression at this point, it makes sense to stop it here rather than waiting until I am half immobilized to do so.\nWill they 100% for sure? No, but the odds are good in preventing further disability progression. For me that is absolutely worth it. My doc recommended the orals and I chose Gilenya and have done really well on it so far. I've been on it for a few months and will undergo more MRIs early next year to see if I have any new lesion activity.\n** Moderator's note - Post broken into paragraphs for easier reading.

I believe that I may be one of the most annoying MSer's on this site. Now to your point, I have PPMS and, until this year, there hasn't been any DMT/DMD . The DMD's available before 2017 were developed and FDA approved to treat RRMS. When I realized, 8 years ago, that progressive MS had no drug therapies, and there were 12 or 13 approved DMD's for treating RRMS, I began emailing and screaming at the FDA and the NMSS about this outrage. So, this year, I stopped screaming (about that point, anyway).\nI believe that the data is clear that your chances of slowing the progression of MS is increased by being on a DMD. I have been infused with Lemtrada and will be infused with that drug for my second and final round in January 2018. I hope that you find your answer, and that decision turns out well for you. I went on about my life without treatments for about 8 years and my health suffered.\nYour MS is YOUR MS. MS is extremely individual. I would find a DMD, if I were you. Good luck.",

While this has been seen in an earlier Phase 3 trial, the new trial is much larger — ensuring a much greater volume of data will be collected — and, equally important, it may bring the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to initiate a review of the treatment’s effectiveness as a first step toward possible approval.\"\nhttps://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.c...rederic-sedel/ This was from May, 2017 and haven't taken the time yet to research this further.\nGood news for those of us with progressive form of MS!",

If I get up and \"move around,\" they may abate for a while but sometimes nothing will stop the movement.\nWhen I lay in bed to read and sleep, lots of spasms. If the spasm does stop and I fall asleep, the spasm will wake me anywhere from 1 AM to 3 AM and continue every 20 seconds for hours on end.\nI take baclofen and it sorta kinda works. Better than left untreated.\nIn California marijuana is legal so I will smoke and it will relax the spasm but since the effect of pot lasts for about 1/2 hour, the spasm will often return.\nEnter CBD gummies. My marijuana representive comes to my apartment whenever I need to replenish either my bud or vape pen supply.\nLast time he left samples of an edible CBD gummy for me to try. I ate two and had the best night of sleep in over six years. It could have been a coincidence. Second night, same experience. Third night, no gummies and a typical spasm night. Fourth night, two gummies and restful sleep through the night. Night six, I tried one gummy, not as restful.\nSo now I take two gummies per night and I have uninterrupted sleep.\nIf you live in a state where marijuana is legal, you can PM me and will share the website. The company sells HBD water so I may do two things at once...stay hydrated and quell the spasm beast.\nOh and a side note on CBD gummies. No THC so no high effect.

I used it for neuropathy and found it helpful. My BIL and friend used it for diabetic neuropathy and also for arthritis for great benefit,\nMedical Marijuana is now legal in my state and is tightly regulated and very costly. The rules can be very burdensome.\nI started it. You can begin with a CBD:THC ratio of 12:1 which has helped me tremendously with neuropathy and has no psych side effects as it has little THC in it. The THC and CBD work together synergistically to manage pain, go to healer.com\nMy next move is to increase the ratio to 5:1 to try to get better control of muscle stiffening and breakthrough spasms. I will see if it has unpleasant psychoactive side effects.\nI have blogged this extensively on a different MS board if you're interested. It may give you insight about how it can help.\nIf it's illegal I your state, order some from Edens Cure. I trust the product. It too is costly. Order one bottle and see if it's worth it to you.

I have to say, I'm sorely tempted to give it a try, although to approximate the doses they used in that trial, you'd have to take a lot, and from the time frame they gave, you'd have to keep with it for at least nine months.\nI look at it this way: although I have never been able to get a firm number from anyone, with PPMS, as best as I can tell, I have about a 1 in 3 chance of becoming completely disabled. And by that, I mean bedridden, having to be fed, washed, etc. Maybe the odds are even higher, but I don't know because nobody will tell me. But if I get to that point, I don't think I want to stick around for too long, yanno? So in that trial, they had what, 23 test subjects, and two died, not necessarily from anything to do with the biotin? But let's just say that somehow the deaths were connected, then doing the math, and rounding up, you get a 1 in 10 chance. Which odds sound better to you?\nI know that probability and statistics are way more complicated than that, and there were far too few test subjects, but it sure has me thinking a lot about it. Like you, this news has really grabbed my attention. And try as I may to put the brakes on it, I'm allowing hope to creep back into my outlook.",

I have read the results of the trial and the subjects were taking an extremely high daily dosage of Biotin. It was 300mg a day and this was a highly concentrated pharmaceutical grade. So I would imagine that the stuff you purchase in a supplement form is not going to come close to what they used in the study as they tend to contain lots of \"fillers\" as well. I also found this study to be encouraging.\\ in that 12.6% of the patients taking MD1003 (Biotin) did show improvements in EDSS and the timed 25 foot walk. Not as much as the initial non controlled trial where they saw a 90 plus percent improvement in a smaller pool of subjects...but any improvement is better than nothing. Also the 67% risk of disease progression was encouraging.\nSo I guess I may up my dose of Biotin based on the study and the safety profile. However, I am not getting my hopes up too much in that I am likely not taking a strong enough version or enough in general to make a difference. I have a 6 month neuro appt. on Monday and will get his feedback on this as well.\nAlso for any of you that are interested, there is a FB page out there where they are discussing this very subject....Biotin for Progressive MS.",

    "Post" : "Maybe we should rethink the OTC supplement idea?\nHey guys, I didn't see where anyone mentioned this, but Wheelchair Kamikaze did an April 26 post that includes some discussion of Biotin. The first part is about the Tisch Research Center stem cell trial, which is interesting because it's also about progressive MS, but if you scroll down, you'll see his take on Biotin.\nThe pertinent takeaway:\nEven if the Biotin itself isn't harmful in large doses, non-prescription Biotin supplements may also contain other stuff like calcium that can be really dangerous in the quantities we're talking about. And as we've recently found out, a high percentage of over the counter supplements do not even have a trace of what's on the label, so you could be pounding all those pills for nothing. I completely understand wanting to just go for it because there's nothing else out there for us. I was almost going to do it myself.\nBut having said all that, I see no harm in taking the normal dosage because why not?\nBut really, please read his post and the comments. Very worth your time if you're interested in this! It's much more than just the above caution. He even talks about the idea of having it compounded, so it's not just about naysaying.\n**URL removed by Moderator in compliance with MSWorld Guidelines.

    "Post" : "Kamikaze Update\nHey guys, I just want to add something about Wheelchair Kamikaze's post about Biotin. He mentioned something about it being ready for FDA approval by the end of this year! I thought, \"How is it possible it could happen that fast when the trials are being done overseas?\" So I asked him in the comments, and he replied, that yes, it's very possible. After my initial exhilaration, I realized that something being ready for the FDA does not make approval imminent. But still, this seems a lot faster than I imagined.\nI don't know how long the FDA will take to do their thing. I wonder, does anyone know what's their typical time frame for approval?\nAlso, WK speculated that one of the big players, like Biogen, might buy out MedDay. But I guess that wasn't to hard to see coming.",

    "Post" : "I still see a lot of comments asking about \"feeling better\" on Biotin. Feeling better is not the primary goal of any of our disease modifying therapies. All of our medications, including Biotin, are designed to change the natural history of the disease (slow progression). So while Biotin may improve your hair, nails and give you an energy boost your daily symptoms may never change. The real Biotin benefit will hopefully happen over time where you'll have less progression over months or years.\nI would encourage everyone to talk to your neurologist about Biotin and start getting them familiar with the therapy. While you may consider Biotin to be completely innocuous, it's always a good thing that your neurologist is aware of all medications you are taking. Remember the vast majority of Biotin safety data is based on a tiny dose and not a 300 mg mega-dose. Also consider that you are not taking the 1 pill serving, but multiplying it by 20-30 tablets so look at the other ingredients.\nJules - A number of medications are available over the counter (OTC) is one strength and by prescription in another. Vitamin D and Ibuprofen are good examples of this and Biotin will most likely follow this pattern. I have found that Biotin is cheaper in the 5 mg (5,000 mcg) variant than the 10 mg (10,000 mcg) version, but you'll be swallowing twice the number of pills. Based on the current cost of Biotin a one year supply will cost about the same as one week of most of our existing disease modifying drugs. It will be interesting to see how much anyone will be able to charge for a 100 mg pill, but we may soon find out.\nJ-Bo - At minimum, the FDA should grant a Priority Review for Biotin, but it could easily qualify as a Breakthrough Therapy, Accelerated Approval or Fast Track. The progressive MS population has an unmet medical need for a serious medical condition. When you consider Biotin is already on the market the process should be even faster. Biotin won't move quite as fast as the Ebola trial medications, but it should still move much faster than the normal process.\nAs always, I wish you all well.",

That was not listed as of 5/14.\nI had a thought about the clinical trials being run using biotin to treat ON.

That was a very small trial, like 25 or so people, I think. The Phase III trial with a much larger subject group had significantly less impressive results with 12% showing improvement. But still, as I'm sure you know, any treatment for any kind of MS that seems to reverse existing damage, even for just a small percentage of people is really pretty astounding.\nAnd just now, I found this article http://www.healthline.com/health-new...ve-ms-052215#2, which talks more about the theory behind it all in a way that I haven't seen before.

I have to look at things straight on for the best view, my peripheral vision is lacking, low light vision horrid and I often feel a slight sensation as if my eyes have a film on them. My eye exams come back unremarkable so I just get new glasses every couple of years and thats that.\nI hope yours get better soon.",

    "Post" : "I've never been on Zinbryta, but I do know some about its history. Daclizumab was originally sold as Zenapax, an immunosuppressant meant as an anti-rejection drug for kidney transplant patients. One of my docs was considering it for me off-label right before the manufacturer took it off the market.\nIt was taken off the market only because there are more effective drugs available for anti-rejection and it wasn't selling well, so the manufacturer found another use for it. And now it's called Zinbryta and approved for RRMS.\nSort of like after a couple of people died in the clinical trial of alemtuzumab for rheumatoid arthritis, the manufacturer realized that people with RA weren't willing to risk death and it probably wouldn't sell well. So they found another use for it. And now it's called Lemtrada and approved for RRMS.\nThe repurposing of these meds demonstrates that immunosuppression can be effective in treating MS. But they're both heavy-duty meds, and a person who chooses one of them has to be prepared for the possibility of serious side effects. Zinbryta has a black box warning about the danger of severe liver damage and other immune-mediated disorders.",

For instance I avoided DMDs with GI side effects after recovery from decades of incontinence sx.\nI tried Tefederia and Aubagio but decided the oral meds weren't for me.

Before the 2 oral meds, I was on Tysabri. I wasn't sure I would make it past first three months, the early months were brutal for fatigue. After my 3rd Tysabri infusion, following decades of insomnia and bowel incontinence, both resolved, which were life changing improvements.\nDuring the year spent untreated my strength and gait have progressed quite a bit.

I am JCV+ preventing my neurologist from writing a Tysabri script (I have a Veterans Affairs primary neurologist and he sends me to see two MS specialists once/year).\nUnlike DMTs that are indicated for MS, Rituximab does not have just one treatment protocol. I believe the most common dose is two infusions, two weeks apart as a loading treatment. Then one infusion every six months into perpetuity. There are some doctors that use blood tests to determine when the next infusion occurs. My doctor wanted two infusions, two weeks apart twice per year.\nNow, I have been reduced to one infusion every six months. It was weird not doing injections or taking daily pills, but I love needing treatment only every six months.\nI have not had an infusion reactions, but I do premedicate and stay super-hydrated around infusion times. That hydrated, I take the recliner closest to the bathroom.\nIt took almost two full months to notice a difference, but now I am doing better than I have in years. My brain is clearer, my stamina and energy has increased.\nOcrelizumab wasn't approved until a week after my last Rituximab infusion. I was given permission to switch to Ocrelizumab in the fall, but I have decided not to switch at this time. My doctor would prefer me on Rituximab and that's good enough for now. I desparately need his help in two non-related areas so keeping him happy is important right now.\nThe Rituximab patient that just contracted PML, after years of Tysabri use, was the final straw.

You might want to? Why would you want to?\nYour post didn't contain one shred of an indication or evidence that your doctor \"made a mistake\" in diagnosing you with SPMS. The only possible mistake I can see is the invention of unsavory innuendo against a doctor for the sole purpose of finding a scapegoat to blame for your insurance company denying your medication request. What an awful thing to do to someone. What an awful thing to suggest that someone do to someone.\nIs there any reason you might think your doctor made \"a mistake\" in diagnosing you with SPMS?\nAnd who would you ask about this alleged \"mistake\"? Your neurologist? What could your doctor possible say in response to that other than some version of, \"A copy of your medical records will be ready for you tomorrow so you can find another neurologist you trust more than me.\"\nHave you talked with your neurologist about your insurance company's denial of Ocrevus? Have you talked about a plan for appeal or treatment with a different medication?\nThe NMSS website (http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Wha...Progressive-MS) lists several medications as being \"approved by the FDA for use in relapsing forms [plural, emphasis mine] of MS, which include those individuals who have transitioned to secondary-progressive MS but continue to have relapses and/or evidence of disease activity on MRI.\"\nTheir The MS Disease-Modifying Medications brochure (http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Nat...edications.pdf) uses the term \"relapsing forms of MS in the FDA Approval column of their medication table. And not only the NMSS brochure, but also the Ocrevus prescribing information -- the ultimate source for a medication's FDA approval information -- describes Ocrevus as being approved for \"relapsing or primary progressive forms of MS\" -- NOT specifically relapsing-remitting only. SPMS with relapses is still relapsing MS.\nHave you had a relapse in, say, the last two years that can qualify your SPMS as relapsing? Perhaps the NMSS and/or Genentech might be able to provide approval information that might help you in an appeal with your insurance company.\nAnd perhaps a more realistic question to ask your neurologist is whether s/he would consider changing your diagnosis back to RRMS?\nThe NMSS medications brochure can provide information to help you and your neurologist look into other medication possibilities. They include mitoxantrone, an older drug that has gone generic (meaning less expensive for your insurance company) that was approved for secondary progressive.\nMy insurance company (an HMO) approved Rituxan off-label for me for RRMS with no questions asked. I had 4 doses (the usual 2 doses 2 weeks apart, repeated 6 months later). Rituxan didn't help me. Sort of the reverse. Both times I relapsed about 4 weeks after the second dose, which meant I was flaring more frequently on Rituxan than before I started it. So of course I didn't continue.\nI hope you can find a treatment med for relapsing forms of MS that works for you, maybe even Ocrevus on appeal. Good luck!",

Now, when something happens, I know I am stuck with it.\nI have tried ever class of drugs for MS (even been a test subject for Avonex's initial trial) except Aubagio because one of the side effects is vision problems. As I have already lost one eye to Optic Neuritis 20 years ago, I don't feel that is a risk I want to take. No, I don't think my doctor thought a rejection was coming because the time my insurance rejected Rituxin, they said it was because it was not FDA approved for MS. The FDA approved this version of a monoclonal antibody, so easy-peasy, right?\nNevertheless, my neurologist has removed all of the SPMS language to the recent appeal letter.

Will everyone who has primary progressive MS benefit from Ocrevus?\nA. We don’t know, since like all clinical trials, the Ocrevus trial in primary progressive MS limited the characteristics of people who could participate. The trial only included people who were aged 18 to 55, who had an EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale – a scale to assess neurological functioning used in clinical trials) score of up to 6.5 (meaning they were able to walk with the help of a walker or bilateral crutches or other devices on both sides), and who had evidence of immune proteins in a test of their spinal fluid (“oligoclonal bands”). It is not possible to predict how a specific individual will respond to treatment. The use of Ocrevus in clinical practice will help determine who is likely to benefit.\nQ. Is it better to take it earlier than later for treating progressive MS?\nA. In the ORATORIO trial for primary progressive MS, the average time from diagnosis in participants was 3.3 years. It is not known how the medication will work in people who have had primary progressive MS for longer periods of time.\nThat helped my curiosity a little. I guess you really just have to try the drug to know for sure if it will help (like all the other DMT's).\nTake Care",

Does that mean per monthly infusion?\nWill they have co-pay assistance considering most if not all MSers with PPMS do not work.\nHi durgastiger,\nThe drug assistance programs are different for all the the Disease Modifying Therapies, so what exactly what this will be remains to be seen. There are also differences what you can qualify for, whether you have private insurance, or government related insurance (Medicare, Medicaid, or Veteran's), and can include income requirements for eligibility. But, since now Ocrevus has been approved by the FDA as the only DMT available for PPMS, it should be an available option under most, if not ALL, prescription plans. These are excerpts from the National MS Society:\nFDA Approves Ocrevus (Ocrelizumab) for People with Primary Progressive MS or Relapsing MS -- First Disease-Modifying Therapy for Primary Progressive MS\nFor more information, people with MS can contact Genentech at: 1-844-OCREVUS (9am-8pm Eastern)\nFor people who qualify, Genentech plans to offer patient assistance programs through Genentech Access Solutions: (866) 4ACCESS/(866) 422-2377 or http://www.Genentech-Access.com.\nComment on Pricing\nThe approval of Ocrevus is an exciting milestone for people with primary progressive MS and an encouraging new option for people with relapsing forms of the disease. The National MS Society applauds Genentech for their leadership in setting the wholesale acquisition cost (or list price) of Ocrevus at $65,000 per year -- nearly 20 percent below the current market average for an MS treatment. The continually escalating prices of MS disease-modifying therapies are creating barriers to people with MS getting these life-changing medications. Through its action on Ocrevus, Genentech is changing industry dynamics so that more people can access the life-changing treatments they need to live their best lives. We encourage other companies to follow suit, creating a drug pricing trend that keeps patients first.\nFAQ About FDA Approval of Ocrelizumab – brand name Ocrevus™ – for Primary Progressive and Relapsing Forms of MS\nQ. How is ocrelizumab taken?\nA. Ocrevus is administered by intravenous (into a vein) infusion every 6 months. At the beginning of treatment there are two doses separated by 14 days. After that, there is a single infusion every 6 months.\nQ. When will ocrelizumab be available by prescription?\nA. According to Genentech, people may talk to their MS doctors now about taking Ocrevus. The company expects supplies of the therapy to be available in about two weeks (around the week of April 4, 2017). Accessing the medication also depends on issues related to an individual’s health insurance.\nQ. What if I no longer live in my own home. Can I still get Ocrevus if I live at an assisted living facility or a nursing home?\nA. Whether you live at home or in a facility should not affect your ability to be on Ocrevus. However, insurance coverage may impact access to the medication.\nQ. What will Ocrevus cost?\nA. The list price has been announced as $65,000 per year. However, the price of Ocrevus to an individual who has MS will depend on the provisions of his or her insurance coverage and the degree to which that individual will be eligible for programs designed to assist with out-of-pocket costs.\nQ. What is the National MS Society’s response to the posted price of Ocrevus?\nA. The approval of Ocrevus is an exciting milestone for people with primary progressive MS and an encouraging new option for people with relapsing forms of the disease. The National MS Society applauds Genentech for their leadership in setting the wholesale acquisition cost (or list price) of Ocrevus at $65,000 per year — nearly 20 percent below the current market average for an MS treatment.

Through its action on Ocrevus, Genentech is changing industry dynamics so that more people can access the life-changing treatments they need to live their best lives. We encourage other companies to follow suit, creating a drug pricing trend that keeps patients first.\nQ. Will my health insurance cover Ocrevus?\nA. Coverage will depend on individual insurance plans. For people who qualify, Genentech plans to offer patient assistance programs through Genentech Access Solutions: (866) 4ACCESS/(866) 422-2377 or http://www.Genentech-Access.com.\nQ. Where can I get information about the support that Genentech will provide to help people gain access to Ocrevus?\nA. Physicians and people with MS can contact Genentech for information about access at Genentech Access Solutions: (866) 4ACCESS/(866) 422-2377 or http://www.Genentech-Access.com.\nhttp://www.nationalmssociety.org/Abo...izumab)-as-the",

    "Post" : "Ocrevus Assessment Report European Medicines Agency November 2017\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/...C500241126.pdf\nI believe it is prudent to monitor closely for breast cancer since there were more cancer cases, and especially breast cancer, which showed up with Ocrevus during trials than with the two comparators which were Rebif and placebo.\nWe should remember that in trials… RRMS Ocrevus (n-825, the number taking it) was compared to Rebif (n-826) and in PPMS (n-486) Ocrevus was compared to placebo (n-239).\nQuoting from page 140 (the italics are mine) … QUOTE “Malignancies\nRMS (relapsing MS) … the rate per 100PY (PY = patient years) of malignancy was 0.14 … for the IFN (Rebif) group and 0.28 for the OCR (ocrelizumab) group.”\nPPMS (Primary Progressive MS) The rate per 100PY of malignancy events was 0.30 … for the placebo group and 0.92 for the OCR group.” End Quote\nQuoting, from pages 149 and 150\n“At least 1173 MS patients have been exposed to the proposed dose 600 mg dose for more than 95 weeks. However, long-term exposure data do not allow conclusive evaluation of the risk of malignancies as well as rare risks, such as PML. The RMS and PPMS patient population included in the controlled MS trials is a selected patient population, not entirely representative of the MS patient population target of the two claimed indications.\nFor instance median age of PPMS enrolled patients was 46 years...\nThere is no information regarding patients older than 55 years. The absence of safety data in patients ≥55 years of age requires a more cautious approach with regard to the observed imbalance in malignancies, including breast cancer, observed in OCR-treated patients relative to comparator (IFN or placebo), as it is well known that the risk of malignancies increases with age.” End Quote\nI quote page 172 broken into paragraphs for readability …\n3.5 Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects\n“More than 1173 MS patients were exposed to the proposed dose 600 mg dose for more than 95 weeks with a total of 4485 patient years of exposure to ocrelizumab in the MS population. However, even if this is a large safety database rare adverse events or adverse events likely to occur later might not have been captured. In particular, available long term exposure data do not allow to conclusively evaluate both the risk of malignancies as well as PML.\nMoreover, the exclusion of patients >55 years old, prevents the assessment of the safety profile of OCR in the elderly, in particular with respect to malignancies, the risk of which is known to increase with age.\nPatients with a history of recurrent or chronic infections or immunodeficiency, and patients with a history of ischemic cerebrovascular disorders were excluded from the pivotal trials.\nCardiovascular disease was not among exclusion criteria, but there was only one enrolled patient with a history of cardiovascular disease (SMQ cardiac failure). The safety of OCR in the presence of the above mentioned morbidities is thus not assessable at present.\nOpportunistic infections, but not PML were seen in the RA population where ocrelizumab exposure corresponds to 7324 patients years albeit in dose levels ranging from 20 mg to 2000 mg. Opportunistic and serious infections was also seen in the SLE and LN population and 6% and 3%, respectively died in these population due to infections.\nIt is uncertain if safety data from these patient populations can be extrapolated to the MS population as patients in the RA, SLE and LN population also received additional immunosuppressant treatment, had different comorbidities and the RA population was older than the MS population.\nIt is thus unknown if prior or current immunosuppressant treatment in the MS population will increase the risk of infections. It is also unknown, had the safety database been as large as in RA, if cases of opportunistic infections would have occurred in the MS population.\nUp to the 30 Jun 2016, there were in total 26 cases of malignancies reported in MS patients treated with ocrelizumab. There was an imbalance in the incidence of malignancies in the ocrelizumab groups compared to IFN and placebo with a cluster of breast cancers in the ocrelizumab groups.\nThere were no cases of breast cancer in the IFN or placebo groups whereas there were 3 cases in the RMS ocrelizumab group and 4 cases in the PPMS ocrelizumab group...\nIn randomised controlled trials only about 20% of randomized RA patients received more than 2 OCR doses and only 38 patients received up to 8 OCR doses in the open label part.\nThe higher incidence of malignancies, with a cluster for breast cancer, observed in OCR-treated patients relative to comparator (IFN or placebo) is a cause of concern, particularly as age >55 years was an exclusion criteria.\nAdditionally, long-term safety has not been investigated, and for this reason the applicant will perform post-approval studies to address this issue.”\nQuoting page 176, “The safety profile of ocrelizumab shows an increased frequency of malignancies compared to control groups, which seem to be driven by a cluster of breast cancer. However, the incidence was not higher as compared to epidemiological data and available data do not allow to definitely establish - nor rule out - a clear causality to ocrelizumab treatment.” End Quotes.\nOnly time and data can definitely establish if cancer is more of a risk with Ocrevus. Breast cancer appeared more frequently than other types in trials. Prudence dictates those taking Ocrevus should closely monitor for cancer, especially breast cancer.",

Haven't heard about a \"Honeymoon period\" before, but doesn't necessarily mean there isn't something like that. It's already being added to some private insurance companies from what I've seen. (I think it might have something to do with the extended FDA ruling date, was first expected last December). Then there's the delay waiting for prior authorization once your neuro agrees and writes the script, and has filled.out and sent in the required documentation form before insurance will agree to pay for it. (And like Tysabri, infusion center costs are not included in that price). Individual insurance will dictate whether or not this will be approved as a first line treatment for RRMS (same as Tysabri) even though FDA has approved it as one.\nMany questions about Ocrevus are answered in this News from the National MS Society, including that there will be a patient assistance program. Hope those interested in Ocrevus will take the time to read through all of it. http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Abo...izumab)-as-the\nGood luck to everyone who makes the decision with their neuroIogist to go on this drug!",

The testing included walking, eye chart test, blood, pee, and MRI for a baseline measurement.\nWent with ocrelizumab b/c I had failed Copaxone and Gilenya. On Gilenya had gotten a new lesion on spinal chord. With Gilenya I had had no new lesions in 4 years but had 2 relapses per year. Neuro was offering Tysabri and that was going to be the plan, but I am JCV+ and even though it was a low number, Tysabri scares me so I was looking for other options. Seems that Ocrevus is about the same as Tysabri for efficacy without the high risk of PML. Since I was already risking cancer with Gilenya, it seemed not too big of a leap to have a similar risk with Ocrevus. What attracted me as well was the chance of not having so many relapses. I will be losing my health insurance in less than two years and am hoping that they offer to make the trial an extended one.\nHow long did the first infusion take, did you have many facilities to get it at and are the future infusions supposed to take the same amount of time or shorter?\nThere are many trial sites for the trial I´m in- all over the US. I visited two and then picked the one with the people that I connected with. The first infusion took a while- I got there at 8 and left at 2. I had to have a neuro exam prior to the infusion for the trial. The infusion started at about 10:30. You get benadryl, a steroid and then the Ocrevus. They observe for one hour after to be sure there´s no reaction. The benadryl knocked me out for two hours of nap. The next infusion should be shorter b/c there will fewer tests prior to the IV. I am a needle phobe and dealt with it by not looking. The day after it was as if I had not had a new drug in my body- as in no ill effect. With two relapses a year, I should know soon enough if it is working.\nAny details you can share is appreciated. Thanks. keep feeling well with it",

And speaking by Ocrevus, there are countries where you can get the Brand drug from Roche at $5k per infusion, i.e. 10k/year. Why does it cost 65k in the US?\nA few thoughts for you ...\nThe biggest cost driver is drug manufacturers are allowed to set their own prices in the US. In most other countries, the government sets the price point and if the company doesn't accept the price than the drug will not be approved. So the US generally has a larger medication selection, but at a substantially higher price point. The US also subsidizes R&D and also lower costs medications to most of the world. The US gives billions and billions of medication to other countries and that cost gets passed along to US consumers. Just because a medication has an astronomical list price that doesn't mean insurance companies are paying that price. Private insurance companies negotiate lower drug prices than list. Unfortunately, Medicare is prohibited from negotiating lower price points directly with the manufacturer.\nPatients also want to cap their medication expenses so drug companies generally offer co-pay assistance programs. So a drug that lists for $6k/month is reduced to $4k/month by a commercial insurance company. Then the drug company steps in and provides co-pay assistance to the patient who ends up paying $50/month or less. So the numbers start off extremely inflated, but the consumer rarely gets stuck paying anywhere near list price.\nIn the US, manufacturers are also allowed to market directly to patients via magazine, television, radio and even direct mail advertising. Direct marketing is effective and will often have a patient telling the doctor they want \"drug X\" that they saw on TV. Doctors have been sued so frequently that many now practice defensive medicine and give in to patient demands. Doctors also may not prescribe cheaper, but as effective, medications if cost information is not readily available. In addition to manufacturers marketing medications directly to patients, lawyers frequently market class action lawsuits directly to patients as well.\nGovernment inefficiency and bureaucracy also drives up the cost of healthcare. The FDA is often slow to approve both new medications and generic alternatives. Government and insurance red tape is another cost driver. Doctors hire small teams of people to deal exclusively with pre-authorization, special paperwork and coordination between insurance and specialty pharmacy. I do not know of any MS drugs that do not require pre-authorization from an insurance company.\nThe FDA is slow to approve new medications and also generic drugs. Pharmacists cannot always move patients to lower priced generics without patient consent. The brand medications comprise only about 10% of filled prescriptions, but they account for over 70% of all medication costs. Medication costs are under 15% of our total healthcare expenses so Americans are getting fleeced by other areas as well.\nDrug companies get patents for 20 years so they can recoup R&D costs and turn a profit. That keeps generics off the market to lower costs. In the US, R&D costs are astronomical where one Phase III tests costing over $100 million. According to Tufts University a drug costs about $800 million to bring to market in 2003. In 2014, the same medication would not cost $2.6 billion to bring to market. That's a lot of money considering only about 1 in 5,000 experimental drugs make it to market. Investors would be less inclined to invest in Biotech if the potential margins were small. An investor would take that same money and drop it into a McDonald's where small profit is almost guaranteed.",

    "Post" : "I was contacted by the company and was told even if my ins didn't cover it, they have program in place to help.\nThey are even helping with the infusion center.\nContact them for anyone who can't afford $65,000 ever 6 months\nQUOTE=Marco;1502245]A few thoughts for you ...\nThe biggest cost driver is drug manufacturers are allowed to set their own prices in the US. In most other countries, the government sets the price point and if the company doesn't accept the price than the drug will not be approved. So the US generally has a larger medication selection, but at a substantially higher price point. The US also subsidizes R&D and also lower costs medications to most of the world. The US gives billions and billions of medication to other countries and that cost gets passed along to US consumers. Just because a medication has an astronomical list price that doesn't mean insurance companies are paying that price. Private insurance companies negotiate lower drug prices than list. Unfortunately, Medicare is prohibited from negotiating lower price points directly with the manufacturer.\nPatients also want to cap their medication expenses so drug companies generally offer co-pay assistance programs. So a drug that lists for $6k/month is reduced to $4k/month by a commercial insurance company. Then the drug company steps in and provides co-pay assistance to the patient who ends up paying $50/month or less. So the numbers start off extremely inflated, but the consumer rarely gets stuck paying anywhere near list price.\nIn the US, manufacturers are also allowed to market directly to patients via magazine, television, radio and even direct mail advertising. Direct marketing is effective and will often have a patient telling the doctor they want \"drug X\" that they saw on TV. Doctors have been sued so frequently that many now practice defensive medicine and give in to patient demands. Doctors also may not prescribe cheaper, but as effective, medications if cost information is not readily available. In addition to manufacturers marketing medications directly to patients, lawyers frequently market class action lawsuits directly to patients as well.\nGovernment inefficiency and bureaucracy also drives up the cost of healthcare. The FDA is often slow to approve both new medications and generic alternatives. Government and insurance red tape is another cost driver. Doctors hire small teams of people to deal exclusively with pre-authorization, special paperwork and coordination between insurance and specialty pharmacy. I do not know of any MS drugs that do not require pre-authorization from an insurance company.\nThe FDA is slow to approve new medications and also generic drugs. Pharmacists cannot always move patients to lower priced generics without patient consent. The brand medications comprise only about 10% of filled prescriptions, but they account for over 70% of all medication costs. Medication costs are under 15% of our total healthcare expenses so Americans are getting fleeced by other areas as well.\nDrug companies get patents for 20 years so they can recoup R&D costs and turn a profit. That keeps generics off the market to lower costs. In the US, R&D costs are astronomical where one Phase III tests costing over $100 million. According to Tufts University a drug costs about $800 million to bring to market in 2003. In 2014, the same medication would not cost $2.6 billion to bring to market. That's a lot of money considering only about 1 in 5,000 experimental drugs make it to market. Investors would be less inclined to invest in Biotech if the potential margins were small. An investor would take that same money and drop it into a McDonald's where small profit is almost guaranteed.[/QUOTE]",

There is still a good deal of spasticity in my left leg, but I'm hoping that will be addressed at my upcoming Dr. appointment.

I used those for showering until the stitches were out.\nYou can get them big enough to completely cover the incision with a pad.

It might have given me pause before agreeing to an IV dose from time to time.\nI have been diagnosed with an eye condition caused Central Serous Retinopathy. The retinal specialists I see strongly feel it is caused due to my use of high dose (IV) steroids to treat my MS relapses.\nThe symptoms of my eye condition are similar to macular degeneration. Wavy lines, dark/black spots in my vision. Luckily my wavy lines and black spots are just right of my central vision in both eyes so I still technically have 20/20 vision. Usually this condition clears itself up in 2-6 months but I am now 8 months post diagnosis and the doctors feel it might be permanent for me. Additionally I need to avoid steroids if possible or it will get worse.\nI don't want to over scare anyone to not take steroids. They do help shorten the relapse and can be very helpful. I just wish I knew this information so I could make a more informed decision each and every time I took steroids. I might have skipped them from time to time instead of agreeing to take them but I wouldn't avoid steroids 100%. Also this condition is rare and usually in males with high stress levels. I am female with low stress level. Also it's rare to get it in both eyes. I have it in both eyes. So I am rare! Lucky Me!\nI did not take IV steroids that often over the last 13 years. I would estimate maybe once every 3 years or less for maybe 2-3 days at a time. I also rarely took pill steroids for sinus infections.",

I stayed in the hospital 2 nights.\nThe pump incision is about 4 inches long, on the right side of my abdomen just below my waist. It had stitches which were removed after a week or so. The spinal incision was closed with steri-strips. Neither hurt much.\nThe big thing is having to lay flat on your back for 24 hours to prevent a post dural puncture headache. This is a really painful type of headache. If you get one and it doesn't go away, you can have a procedure called a blood patch, which stops it. About 10cc's of blood is drawn and injected into the spine.\nThe pump area is kind of tender for a while. Once it gets healed in it's not noticeable. I sleep on that side without a problem.\nThey pump is originally set to a fairly low dosage, then it is adjusted upward or downward until you have your optimum dosage. It is adjusted with a little hand held computer device that communicates with the pump by holding it against your skin right over the pump.\nIt has relieved the pain the spasticity was causing. I am on a very low dose because one leg is very weak, and baclofen makes it weaker. It's a balancing act.\nThe pump gets refilled with a big scary looking syringe that actually has a pretty small gauge needle. The area over my pump is numb so I don't have any problems with it.\nWhen you have an MRI, it affects the pump and it will have to be checked afterward to be sure it restarts.\nI don't know if I've covered what you want to know, so just ask if you have questions. I wanted to know what it would look like, whether it would be obvious. On me it's not noticeable except for the scar. I'm 5'8\" and 155 lbs. My abdomen probably just looks a little bigger on that side. It's not right under the skin, a layer of fat (?!) on top of it.\nGood luck with your surgery. I hope it goes well.",

Yes, I am a bit apprenensive about the surgery and whether or not the pump will really help my problems, but at this point I feel this is a chance I have to take. Have you seen the paper by Sadiq, \"Long-term intrathecal baclofen therapy inambulatory patients with spasticity\"? It's available on the internet and paints a pretty positive picture of likely outcomes. Another one is by Erwin, \"Intrathecal baclofen in multiple sclerosis:Too little, too late?\" Google should find both for you.",

    "Post" : "Hi Mimibo and Brad\nI wish you both the best with the baclofen pump. I have had a baclofen pump since 1999. I am currently on my 4th pump, which is the 3rd generation of the pump, for me.\nIt has worked well for me. I walk with a cane and also have an AFO on my right leg for foot drop. My spasticity kicked up many notches in 1999 after right foot surgery. My right knee started coming up to my chest, when I was sitting in my recliner.\nMy neuro referred me to a pain management doctor about the pump. I talked with the doctor about the pump and felt comfortable to get the pump implanted.* Disclamer- We did not do a trial before I had my pump implanted*I am a big proponet of the pump trial now.\nAfter my pump surgery, I only had 2 issues...One was that I ended up with migraines for 2 weeks. This is because I didn't come home and lay down for the rest of the day. I didn't have a spinal tap when I got diagnosed and the pump dr didn't tell me that I should lay flat for a good while.\nAfter the 2 weeks of migraines, I noticed that my legs were loose. I notified my pup dr and we changed my pump dose. I was good to go a few days later.\nI also happen to be an Ambassador for Medtronic for the baclofen pump. One of the programs I am part of is doing phone calls with pump patients. The link for the program is\nhttp://www.medtronic.com/us-en/patie...r-program.html\nTake Care, Bob",

    "Post" : "I just read a transcript of an interview by Dr. Vollmer from the RMMS Center in Denver. It sounds like MS can now be considered a chronic condition if caught early. Here are the exciting excerpts.\n\" Our patients that we catch in very early disease, which is newly diagnosed patients, if we put them on these second-generation, highly effective therapies (Tysabri, Lemtrada, Rituxin, and Ovrevus)it's very common for them to come back after a year or two and say they don't feel like they have MS anymore, and we won't see any evidence of the MS progression on the MRI, and most of their symptoms, particularly the most common symptoms-which are fatigue, depression, and cognitive problems-tend to resolve in these patients.\nThose symptoms seem to be related to inflammation. So we have a lot of evidence right now that's really suggesting that for a majority of patients, if we can treat them early enough with the right one of these second-generation drugs to maximize safety, we really can potentially fundamentally change the course of the disease where they don't have to anticipate disability in the future. They can anticipate living a normal life and doing normal things. So MS is probably the most treatable neurological disease in neurology today because of these advances that we've had over the last 20 years.\"\nThe complete article can be found here.\nhttp://www.medpagetoday.com/mastery-...ry-in-ms/63501\nAs for me, I've begun the process of EID, extended interval dosage, for my Tysabri. My neurologist agreed, and my 1st move will be to every 5 weeks. If my MRI looks good in 6 months, we'll move me out to 6 weeks, and then possibly 7. At my age (65), the need for DMD is unknown, but I'm not ready to go without, so this is the next best thing.",

    "Post" : "ICER Report: New Multiple Sclerosis Drugs More Effective, But Safety Concerns Abound\nThree relatively new disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) — alemtuzumab, natalizumab, and ocrelizumab — are significantly more effective than other DMTs in the reduction of relapses in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), according to the latest Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) evidence report.1\nThe ICER report included data from 33 trials of 10 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved DMTs for MS in the context of the therapeutic goal to decrease the frequency of relapses and prevent further disability. In comparing efficacy of all DMTs with safety, none of the agents in the ICER report were deemed “ideal.”\nAnnualized Relapse Rates Among DMTs\nThree of the 4 relatively new DMTs (alemtuzumab, natalizumab, and ocrelizumab but not daclizumab) showed a reduction in the annualized relapse rate (ARR) of approximately 70% compared with placebo.\nThe next most effective agents were fingolimod, daclizumab, rituximab, and dimethyl fumarate, collectively producing a 47% to 54% reduction in ARR.\nThe lowest efficacy (17% to 37% reduction in ARR) was reported in a group of traditional therapies including interferons, glatiramer acetate 20 mg, and teriflunomide.\nSlowing Disease Progression\nThe newly approved agents (including alemtuzumab, ocrelizumab, daclizumab, and natalizumab) showed the most benefits in slowing disability in RRMS compared with placebo (58%, 53%, 46%, and 44% reductions, respectively).\nFour older DMTs — interferon β-1a 30 mcg, interferon β-1a 22 mcg, teriflunomide 7 mg, and glatiramer acetate 40 mg — did not demonstrate significant improvements in disease progression. All others had moderate benefits.\nSafety\nThe safest agents were interferons, glatiramer acetate, and teriflunomide. The least safe, due to the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in patients with positive testing results for the JC virus, were alemtuzumab and natalizumab. Several drugs, including teriflunomide, daclizumab, fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, ocrelizumab, and natalizumab in JC virus-negative patients, were deemed to have moderate safety compared to all other DMTs.\nValue of Therapy Compared to Supportive Care\nThe ICER group developed a simulation model to estimate the lifetime cost of a particular therapy, taking into account wholesale acquisition cost, dosing, administration, monitoring, and average discounts applied. The estimated lifetime drug cost was then used as a basis of comparison with the costs of supportive care that included inpatient and outpatient care from multiple relapses, disease progression, and ultimate mortality from RRMS. Using this model, the related health care costs over a patient's projected lifetime ranged from approximately $572,000 for alemtuzumab to $1.5 million for daclizumab, compared with approximately $333,300 for supportive care. The model took into account costs from relapses and prevented relapses in RRMS, as well as incremental costs-per-life-year gained and quality-adjusted life years.\nUsing an acceptable threshold of $150,000 for cost per therapy, compared with supportive care alemtuzumab ($35,000) provided the highest number of quality-adjusted life years gained at a significantly reduced cost compared with all other therapies (range = $185,000 for interferon β-1b 250 mcg to $341,000 for interferon β- 1a 22 mcg).\nOverall, the report suggests that the improved clinical benefits of newer agents must continue to be weighed against the risks of safety complications and financial burden over a patient's lifetime.\nhttp://www.neurologyadvisor.com/mult...rticle/637539/",

If the risks of Lemtrada become more acceptable for more patients and the demand for it rises, Genzyme will push that subjective \"acceptable threshold\" by raising the cost by $100,000 to put it in the range of other MS drugs. If other companies are getting $185,000 to $341,000, the marketplace has shown that to be the real \"acceptable threshold,\" not $150,000.\nDrugs are just another product, and as with supply and demand for any other product, the sale price is what the market will bear.",

    "Post" : "Originally posted by BeckyB View Post\nNow, age 68. I was dx'd with MS 1990. Started Tysabri 10 years ago. I am now walking without my cane on flat surfaces.Have to go on Medicare Supplement Plus Part D next month. Need to pick a plan to cover the costs of all my perscriptions like: Ampyra, Amrix, Enablex. So far I have only been able to find plans that cost huge dollars like $65,000/year or more. Medicare covers Tysabri? I haven't heard of that. Can someone fill me in about what Medicare covers in regard to Tysabri, Ampyra, Amrix, Enablex?\nI went on Medicare Feb.1 and had my 1st infusion on Thursday. Medicare does cover Tysabri under Part B at 80%. It needs to be done at an approved facility (i.e. most likely hospital), and I had to leave my old facility to go to a hospital where it is now being done. You need to pick up a Medicare Supplement plan that has Plan F. If you do that, the other 20% of the Tysabri infusion will be totally picked up, so no cost to you. I found a monthly supplemental for only $125.\nYour prescriptions are trickier. I was on Ampyra, but my co-pay was subsidized by Acorda, the company that makes Ampyra, and I was only paying $40 a month. That stops once you're on Medicare, and I didn't want to shell out $5000 a year under part D. I switched to 4-AP, basically the generic of Ampyra, and instead of taking 2 pills a day, 12 hours apart, I'm now taking 1 pill, every three hours. My yearly cost is under $600. However, if your other two prescriptions aren't available as generics, you might just want to bite the bullet and pay the $5000 a year. That's the max you'll have to pay.\nI recommend the \"ehealthmedicareplans\" website for different plans. If you have a Costco in your area, you can go through the pharmacy page (right hand column) online to reach them or just go directly to their website. It is very easy to use, and you can compare plans. I found the governmental medicare site a total disaster! Stay away from Medicare Advantage since you have a preexisting condition. I purchased both my supplemental and part D through this site, and the people they connect you with are very knowledgeable and helpful. Just make sure you enter your prescriptions before you start comparing plans to make sure they are in the \"formulary\", a new term you'll need to know. Oh yeah, and make sure you scroll down to the bottom of the page to see \"all plans\". They highlight some on the 1st page, but you need to see them all.\nGood luck! Hope this is helpful. I've gone from almost $13000 year to less than $3000.",

It's all very well to realize that PML is an often-fatal brain infection and to be able to imagine how horrible that must be.\nIt's another thing to know someone who dies of PML. I never met this woman in person but felt as if I knew her pretty well online over the last 12 years or so.\nShe had been on Tysabri about 10 years and was quite happy with it but in December 2016 she developed PML and died a few days ago.

I believe Medigap insurance could be an issue.\nMedicare defines a pre-existing condition as any health condition or disability that you have prior to the coverage start date for a new insurance plan. If you have Original Medicare or Medicare Advantage, you are generally covered for all Medicare benefits even if you have a pre-existing condition or disability. However, if you’re enrolled in a Medicare Supplement (Medigap) plan or have end-stage renal disease (ESRD), there are some exceptions",

    "Post" : "Hi, Lori. I can help with the math part. To find the percentage increase from 29.1 to 42.7, you first find the difference between the two (42.7 - 29.1, which equals 13.6), then you divide the difference by the original number, 29.1. So 13.6/29.1, which equals 46.89, which rounds up to 47%. So that's the percentage increase over 29.1. Hope that helps. :-)",

Is the approval required year after year for the same prescription?\nIt depends on the insurance company (even different plans within the same insurance company can do things a bit differently), and the medication. (Renewal prior auths of previously approved meds are usually approved faster than initial ones - or so I've been told )\nHave Aetna and prior authorization is required once a year for Tysabri. (Ampyra requires prior authorization every 9 months.)\nOur plan is also very unique in how the actual drug Tysabri is billed. (Usually billed on medical portion, because an infusion) Changes were made (it's all about cost effectiveness) a few years ago, causing a lot of unnecessary confusion for my MS Clinic, Infusion Center, myself, and Biogen, especially that first year. My husband also had his Human Resourse Department involved. Unfortunately, no one any of us talked with at my insurance company was providing the correct information. In the end, it was my infusion center who ate the cost for my medication until it was finally sorted out.\nHopefully, your insurance company can provide you with this information. Good luck",

    "Post" : "I think this post could fit in several places but I'll start here and see where it ends up.\nAfter a long wait which I patiently endured (NOT) I got my new prescription for adderall and feel so much better and less cloudy and am out the door soon to go exercise. However it could have easily ended up badly. Because I self-medicated.\nIt's so easy for those of us who live with chronic disorders to cross the line beyond healthy proactiveness. We are responsible for our health (just not solely); we know how drugs affect us on a 24/7 level; we have lots of time (maybe) to go online and do research; we may have a vast array of unused bottles or prescriptions; all this knowledge and access might make us believe we deserve an honorary phd in pharmaceuticals.\nOn a personal level I was so frustrated with my energy level and weightgain (160) I took it upon myself to double my prozac and add more coffee. Far from feeling better I became agitated and I started having racing thoughts. So I decided to take some seroquel which can serve as an antimanic agent. I also added in some latuda bc it gives me akathesia and I thought maybe the constant desire to move would at least give some form of energy/movement. Sure it will. Compulsive uncomfortable movement.\nThe sad irony is that if my doctor had seen me maybe two days before he may have suspected some hypomania at the least, and may have decided not to prescribe the adderall. I told him everything up front. He agreed with the calming effects of seroquel but rightly said the prozac and latuda were not helpful which I assured him I had already stopped. He's known me for years and knows I'm more sensible than not (and probably knows I might do something stupid again) so he wrote me prescriptions and added seroquel and adderall.\nIn hindsight it was not worth it. And I could have easily sabotaged my well-being. Thanks to an understanding doctor I am out of my funk, am looking at my future more hopefully and looking into clinical dietician as a field. I am full of hope and feel better and am sleeping better and feeling better during the day. I don't know how long this will last but I do know I could potentially be feeling much worse, even to a dangerous extent.\nSo I will continue adding to my knowledge and work on healthy eating, lifestyle, vitamins, etc. I will still offer my (unsolicited) thoughts on meds but ultimately I will leave the decisions to those who have the expertise and my interests at heart.\nI reached out here and elsewhere and got support in spite of my decisions and just want to say THANKS! while I rode out this mini-rollercoaster.\nI hope anyone who is in a similar situation may get something useful from this post. I hope you don't get to a point where you take things into your own hands. I really hope you don't feel like things couldn't get worse. It certainly wasn't news to me but I did it anyway and am just grateful I landed where I did.",

A number of experts have explained that MS develops when myelin, a substance that protects the nerve cells, is damaged. In turn, biotin is known to be responsible in activating key enzymes and helps the body to produce more of this the nerve-protecting substance.\nBreakthrough Study On Biotin\nMeanwhile, as per News Medical Life Sciences, a study on biotin has found that the substance is allegedly a co-enzyme for several carboxylases, one of which is thought to have a key role in myelin synthesis. Presenter of the study Ayman Tourbah from CHU de Reims, France has noted that a significant number of physicians have scored patients receiving biotin (300 mg/day) between no change and much improved, whereas they were found to have scored those in the placebo group between no change and much or very much worse. Ultimately, Tourbah said that the findings reportedly confirm the clinical relevance of the trial's previously reported primary finding.\nThe rest of the story can be found here: http://www.itechpost.com/articles/82...osis-catch.htm",

I felt much stronger when I first got home, but after a few weeks I have been extreme weaker.\nBefore the surgery, the anesthesiologist gave me some steroids and I'm wondering if maybe that helped me.\nThe steroids you had before surgery might have made you feel \"stronger\" because one of the side effects of steroids is hyperactivity. I once wallpapered a bedroom all by myself after a Solu-Medrol 3-day. And my refrigerator had never been so clean.\nYou might be feeling weaker now simply because of the inactivity that comes with having a broken leg. Even otherwise healthy people routinely need physical therapy to rebuild their strength after a having a broken leg. Remember, not everything is MS.\nThe purpose of all of the immunosuppressant and immunomodulatory drugs is to keep people OFF steroids whenever possible. If you're secondary progressive and still having inflammation, the better route is to be on one of the MS treatment meds and NOT try to replace them with steroids. If you're on an MS treatment med and you think a different med might work better for you, that's a great conversation to have with your neurologist.\nThe only situation I can think of where periodic steroids might be taken instead of an MS med is a case of relapsing, inflammatory MS when none of the MS meds are effective or tolerable, or if the risks of all of the meds are greater than the risks of steroids for that person. That's quite rare, and I know that because I'm one of those people.\nYou really DON'T want to be taking periodic steroids. If you think having a broken femur is bad, think about having multiple broken bones from osteoporosis caused by steroids.",

    "Post" : "Originally posted by pennstater View Post\nUntil the FDA is pressured into listing MS Fatigue as usage, we are at our insurer's mercy.\nThat isn't how it works. The FDA doesn't choose what a drug is used for. The use is chosen by the patent holder/manufacturer in their new drug application.\nThe use is chosen by the applicant. The applicant presents clinical data that, it is hoped, demonstrates that the drug is safe (which is a relative term) and effective for the use being applied for. The FDA then approves or rejects the drug for that specific use. The FDA has no influence over what use is chosen, or the use the drug is approved for, other than to agree that the drug is safe and effective for that use.\nBecause drug trials cost multi-millions of dollars, drug companies limit the number of uses applied for in order to keep the cost of the trials down. If there is the potential of profit for other uses, the company will then run more clinical trials for the second purpose. It has to apply for the additional use(s) separately.\nAn example of this is Ampyra, which is approved only to increase walking speed. There doesn't appear to be any potential for profit in testing and applying for another other use.\nAnother example is Tysabri. After it was approved for MS, Biogen did separate trials and applied separately for its approval for treatment of Crohn's disease. Obviously there was the potential for profit in using it to treat another disease.\nThe specific use(s) for a drug is part of the drug's labeling. The FDA doesn't forbid use of drugs off-label, but it forbids drug companies to advertise or in any way promote off-label uses.\nOnce a drug loses patent protection and goes generic, there's no motivation for anyone to do clinical trials to get a new use approved. They can't get another patent for that use because it's the same drug, and there's no way to make back the money that would be spent on drug trials.\nNor does the FDA have any influence over what drugs insurance companies put on their formularies or what uses of the drugs the insurers cover.\nSo that's why the FDA can't be pressured to add an approved use to force an insurer to cover the cost of a drug. They don't control it.",

    "Post" : "I had no problems with coverage\nWhen my Neuro prescribed 100 mg Modafinil, I had no problems with the insurance (UHC) covering it and my co-pay was $70. I think he had to tell them it was specifically for MS. The 100 mg had no effect so he upped it to 200mg per day and that helped with my fatigue for a few months but then seemed to stop working. I may be switched to Nuvigil soon (Dr appt next week, so we'll see). As stated by someone above, it is a lot to pay for a drug when it seems to not be working anymore.\nTeri",

    "Post" : "I had a lot of trouble with insurance approval. First time they denied it and my neurologist filed a lot of paperwork and I was able to get it for a year. This past January they denied it again even though I was taking it and it was really making a difference for me. They said I needed to have sleep apnea or narcolepsy to get it approved this year. Ridiculous!\nAnyway had a sleep study to try to get some proof for insurance since I have had sleep issues of waking up every 90 minutes every night. Well I have sleep apnea so got the Modafinil back. Didn't believe I had that and still not sure since I still wake up every 90 minutes with the mask on. Just had second study in the hospital which didn't show sleep apnea so seeing sleep neurologist again this week to decide what's going on.\nI'm afraid though if they take back the diagnosis I'll lose the Modafinil which will mean tough days ahead. I just had to come off Ampyra two weeks ago because I'm having seizures now. Without both not sure if I'll get back to work after I recover from this relapse.\nSorry for going off track but yes some insurances can be real tough on allowing Modafinil for MS. Good luck with the battle!\n** Moderator's note - Post broken into paragraphs for easier reading.

WHY??????\nIs that the cost through your insurance company pharmacy?\nIt may not matter where those prices came from. The discrepancy between the two prices is because the $8 price is obviously a mistake. $80 for 30 200-mg pills is still suspiciously low, but at least it's approaching the realm of reality.\nModafinil is expensive. Even the lowest prices for 30 pills are rarely under $100. So at an average low cost of about $125 for 30 pills, the $243 cost for 60 pills is the realistic one.\nIf you can actually get 30 pills for about $8, that would be a gift. You should probably say grace every time you take one.",

    "Post" : "Hi Ikaika:\nOriginally posted by Ikaika View Post\nIs it possible that the Carbamazepine ER formula could have different side effects than the normal release tablets?\nThe side effects for the ER formula might be the same as for the normal release, but because of the extended release, the side effects are also extended release -- they can't clear up quickly as they would with the formula that clears quickly. Because the side effects can't clear up quickly, they might seem different.\nOriginally posted by Ikaika View Post\nDoctor and Pharmacist said the 200mg ER is a 24 hour release tablet. But the paperwork that come with the Rx say 12 hour. Anyone in the know?\nYou would do better to rely on the scientific information in the prescribing information, which has been reviewed and approved by the FDA.\nYour doctor and pharmacist are correct that the ER formula has the capability of releasing something over 24 hours. But that doesn't at all mean that the tablets release a perfectly metered amount of medication that is exactly the same over 24 hours and that the med only needs to be taken once every 24 hours. (I can see how your doctor may not understand this, but your pharmacist should know better.)\nThe amount of medication varies over the 24 hours, and the level peaks in the blood somewhere between 3 and 12 hours (which could be why you're waking up swollen and puffy if you take it at bedtime). And that's why, in regular usage, the ER version is taken 2X a day instead of once -- because the peak level should be renewed every 12 hours, not every 24. The normal/conventional tablets peak at about 4-5 hours, and they're usually taken 4X a day to renew the peak level about every 4-5 hours.\nOriginally posted by Ikaika View Post\nThis med seems to be the best choice out of all the other ines for me, so I'm trying to figure how to take it and not swell back up like a balloon.\nIf your body can't release the extended edema that may come with the extended-release med, you may not be a candidate for the ER version. The normal, quicker-acting med may allow the edema to dissipate quickly so it doesn't accumulate and you don't swell up, but the trade-off may be that you'll have to take the med more often. But that might not be so bad if you can get the benefits of the med without accumulated side effects.",

    "Post" : "I pray you are feeling better now! Some relief!!\nOriginally posted by AriD View Post\nUpdate from my above response about having reaction to tegretol and coming off it. I had a mild rash on my arms so stopped taking it. Took neurontin instead.\nEight weeks ago, I started having myoclonic seizures/ movement disorder. Got high dose steroids oral then one week later high dose iv steroids when the oral doses didn't stop them. Still had them.\nSo my doctor increased my neurontin and started me on clonazapam for seizures without effect. My doctor decided to try tegretol again since I only had had a mild rash. Seizures went away within a couple of days. Was so happy...\nWell, two weeks later I got so sick. High fevers, rigors, increased liver functions, severe leg spasms, and more. Was hospitalized for a week. Multiple tests. No infection. The infectious disease doctors told me they have seen this with tegretol many times before. That I was lucky I got into the hospital when I did. Still trying to recover. Out of work eight weeks so far.\nSo no more tegretol for me. Off for two weeks now and no seizures yet. But just started having weird electrical sensations in my right arm which was happening when I had the seizures. Hoping hoping they aren't coming back.\nTegretol can do wonders but be cautious of its devastating side effects.\nPlease forgive my VERY delayed reply!!!! I read your post and have been praying for you and so sad you had been going through this. I have been praying for you indeed!!!!\n(Reason for my delay is I have been having a joy ride too, not. ER, concussion, new lesions, couldn't stand up, all that jazz...)\nAnyway, I truly hope you have received some relief from the seizures and all of the symptoms. That is very difficult, and through your hardships you even toook the time to post on here and help me. May God bless you with His Favor tenfold and His Healing upon you.\nI have since stopped the Tegretol. And started a medicine called Trokendi XR. I believe the generic is topirimate. I take a very small dose only at night and it helps so much with the tremors. I don't have any side effects nor swelling, just relief so my brain stops getting those surges at night.\nPraying for you! Thank you again for your posts and information. Praying for everyone living with MS and these bizarre, challenging times. And praying for all the angels helping!!!",

    "Post" : "Hi BDOBBINS,\nI'm wondering if you have talked to prescribing Dr. about this and what risks did s/he say?\nHere's what the FDA says:\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is updating health care professionals and the public about the risk of seizures in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who are starting Ampyra (dalfampridine). Using information received from post-market adverse event reports, FDA recently evaluated seizure risk in MS patients taking Ampyra (dalfampridine). The majority of seizures happened within days to weeks after starting the recommended dose and occurred in patients having no history of seizures.\nIn addition, FDA is updating the Ampyra drug label to clarify recommendations that kidney function should be checked in patients before starting Ampyra and monitored at least annually while Ampyra treatment continues. Additionally, patients who miss a dose should not take extra doses—an extra dose of Ampyra can increase seizure risk.\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm312846.htm\nSometimes I help babysit my grandchild along with her other grandma and I can understand your concern. If your grandchild is old enough to call 911 on their own just in case you do have a seizure, you can be better equipped and somewhat more confident in babysitting alone.\nI took Ampyra awhile back for 6 months. It didn't help my walking at all, so I quit. I never had a seizure, but we are all different! Please don't take any others experience as guidance, and talk with your Dr.\nI hope you can work this all out. Maybe have another adult with you to help babysit while you start Ampyra? Best of luck.",

    "Post" : "Ocrelizumab was originally developed as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. During trials, a few patients developed infections and died. It was decided that RA patients weren't willing to risk death from a treatment drug, so the manufacturer abandoned it as a treatment for RA.\nThe manufacturer recognized through the history of Tysabri that MS patients are willing to risk death from a drug. Coupled with the favorable results experienced by some patients with RRMS, the manufacturer quickly switched the target audience for ocrelizumab to people with MS. Fortunately, no patients with MS died during the clinical trial.\nOne thing that's being overlooked about ocrelizumab is that its predecessor, Rituxan, was tested in PPMS and was, overall, no more effective than placebo. In PPMS, it was found that 1) younger patients with 2) inflammatory activity did slightly better as a subgroup.\nThe only difference between ocrelizumab and rituxumab is the source of the antibody. Yet somehow, the results for ocrelizumab in PPMS were better. So it remains to be seen whether that was a statistical fluke, a result of deliberate subject choice, a direct result of using human cells as a source, or something else.\nThis drug isn't that much different from the one that led to several deaths and was not effective in PPMS. In spite of how neat and tidy the clinical trial for PPMS was, I think we all should be prepared for the possibility that older PPMS patients who don't have active, inflammatory disease will get no benefit from ocrelizumab -- and that will be after they have several doses and gotten their hopes up unrealistically high. And I think we should be prepared for the possibility that some MS patients may die from infections.\nIn RRMS, rituxumab appears to have many successes. Being that ocrelizumab is similar, it's realistic to expect that we should see similar results.",

    "Post" : "Hi vender:\nOriginally posted by vender View Post\nI am looking for a drug that lessons the daily pains. Helps with my walking, leg cramps... Helps with BINO (I know no such thing). Helps with numbness. Eye pain. Stops lesions?\nYou're looking for A drug? One drug to make MS go away? There isn't a magic bullet for MS. If there were, everyone with MS would be skipping and twirling down flowery lanes without a care in the world.\nThere are multiple drugs available to manage -- not cure -- individual issues, including disease treatment and symptom management. And there's a lot of information about them to learn that no one can spoon feed to you. The only way to learn is to do the work of studying and learning about them by yourself.\nSo I second the previous poster's advice to go to the website of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and study up on the available medications. But even more... Read over ALL of the educational material on the website, then read it again and again until you think you have a good feel for it. There are no shortcuts for learning about and living with MS.\nOriginally posted by vender View Post\nI know that the info is on the web I just can't read for long periods and what better place for info than you folks...\nTo the contrary. When you read a forum, you're reading the web just the same as you're reading any other website -- 5 minutes of reading is 5 minutes of reading, no matter where it is. So if duration of reading is a challenge, you can cover one eye to get rid of the double vision, turn up the magnification and read slowly. I know that's not what you wanted to hear, but that's the reality of it.\nFrom my years of reading MS forums, it's obvious that at least 75% of people have no grasp of the facts of MS, even after having MS for decades, and disseminate misinformation that can be harmful to a newbie like yourself. So there are MANY better places to get factual information about MS than a forum. Forums are great places to talk about experiences, feelings, opinions and recommendations, but they're terrible for facts.\nHere's my other recommendation about meds. There are no medications that repair MS damage, so you're not looking for a fix-it med. (If you are, stop it. ) The purpose of the MS disease-modifying meds is to try to prevent further disease activity/damage and maybe create a quieter environment in which existing nerve damage can heal (maybe, maybe not).\nEverything with the meds is a trade-off among risks, benefits and individual conveniences. And this is critical: the meds have different rates of statistical effectivity. They have to be viewed by weighing off the best estimate of success vs. the risk taken.\nThe injectible drugs are first-generation meds that have the lowest statistical rate of effectiveness. Since MS has already hit you so hard, it's probably in your best interest to start with a med with a higher rate of effectiveness. Right now the drug with the highest rate of effectiveness with a reasonably well known risk profile is Tysabri. If you're a candidate for it, would you want to start with a drug that isn't known to work as well?\nThere are no guarantees because all drug effects are individual. Some people have done very well on the lower-effectivity injectible drugs and some have done terribly on Tysabri, the higher-rated oral meds and the off-label chemo agents. You have to just pick a med and start on it based on your own medical profile and your tolerance for risk vs. benefit.\nAgain, you have to do your own studying and make your own choices -- without relying on horribly unreliable forum opinions posing as facts and the \"it's too hard to read\" excuse that will lead you into unfortunate shortcuts.\nThere's a lot of work for you to do. So read up and then come back and ask questions. Happy studying.",

    "Post" : "Originally posted by vender View Post\nThis is just above my pay scale.\nHi Mark:\nIt’s fine to delegate or to buy out technical expertise. We do it all the time, and it’s what we do with medical professionals. And it’s OK to rely on technical experts now, while you’re still in shock, fear, anger and grief.\nBut there’s no escaping the fact that each one of us is ultimately responsible for ourselves. The quality of your life depends in many ways on the decisions you make, so there can’t be anyone at a higher pay grade than you. Unless you become incompetent, you’re the one who’s responsible for you.\nYou can delegate, but that’s not a substitute for participation. If you don’t participate, you’re just giving your power away. And the more power you give away, the more you allow yourself to turn into a helpless victim. Is that a road you want to go down?\nRight now you might think you’re relying on your “awesome” doctors. But I have to wonder how it came to be that your “awesome” doctors didn’t step up and use their skills to take control of your complicated case and make the decisions they should be making for you. Somehow you ended up wandering the Internet by yourself, in situations you shouldn’t be in. That could have been prevented. It’s not surprising that you’re feeling so overwhelmed. So unless that’s how you want to stay, at some point you'll have to start making some decisions for yourself.\nOriginally posted by vender View Post\nThe other day I was just standing talking then I just dropped. No warning. No passing out. Like a doll. Lost all control. Is this MS?\nIt could be MS, but if it is it's a highly atypical presentation.\nOriginally posted by vender View Post\nIs this the crap you all deal with?\nNo, because that isn't how MS generally works.\nFunctionally, MS is an impairment of the transmission of electrical signals along nerves. Either the transmission is faulty – like along a wire without insulation – or the wires don’t conduct at all. It's a fairly constant environment. It’s not at all typical for electrical impulses to just shut off, causing a fall.\nIn MS, falls are most often caused by a leg, legs or core muscles being too weak to hold the person up, or by a loss of balance. Falls in MS aren’t caused by dropping for no reason. That sounds more typical of an electrical disruption in the brain, or a seizure.\nIf I’m remembering correctly, you said you had an EEG that was normal. But the most that can be said for that is that it was normal only for the hour or two you were hooked up to the EEG machine. It doesn't in any way guarantee that something abnormal isn't going on the rest of the time.\nIt might be a good idea to talk to your neurologist about a 24-hour ambulatory EEG to get a better idea of what’s going on under real-life conditions. MS is known to cause seizures under the right conditions, so the idea can't be written off just because an initial EEG was normal.\nFor the treatment med, the statistics point to Tysabri for your complicated case. If it agrees with you, it can give you some relief from progression for at least couple of years.\nFinally, my last recommendation is to urge you to stay as active as you comfortably can, and balance that by learning how to meditate. It will come in really handy later.",

Add to that, sometimes our cognitive abilities are affected by MS or symptoms that interfere with our ability to read, focus, understand, and/or remember. Of course, MS is a very complex disease and the medical community's understanding is still evolving as research progresses.\nMy suggestion would be to list what is important to you and your lifestyle, and review with your neuro, asking for their expertise the in pros/cons.\nThe NMSS also has video presentations, which would allow you to listen rather than read.\nI, like Linda am on Tysabri. I wanted to be on highest efficacy there is. And while not everyone experiences it, some people do see improvement on it. For me, I was progressing, and Ty stabilized. What also appealed to me was an Infusion once every 28 days after years of shots. And I don't have to worry if traveling about shots. But Tysabri requires a 3 hour commitment during week, which not everyone can make due to work, other commitments.\nThe other caution I have would be about starting new meds at the same time.

Likewise, any tests needed before you could start. Tysabri requires a blood test to check your JC virus titer number.\nFinally, your insurance may come into play.

SO what is MS what is INO? Should I even start meds. I Blame my eyes for EVERYTHING.\nI do have a great MS neuro. That is her specialty. I know she wants to put me on something very expensive 65K (real useful). Both her and my neuro Op said I need to live with INO!! She is checking with one more specialist for me. I have until the 11th. Thanks again!",

    "Post" : "The DMTs, which include Tysabri, are to slow/prevent disability progression. They are not designed to help with symptoms that have resulted from MS activity.\nFor leg cramps, if caused by MS spasticity, there are separate drugs. Stretching, yoga, exrecise may help as well.\nHeat intolerance, not much for. There are cooling vests, hats, neck wraps, and so on that can help. There have been studies that as little as a 0.5 degree Fahrenheit change can cause symptoms to increase. The good news is that these \"pseudo relapses\" resolve once you cool down, and you are back to your Baseline symptoms.\nWhen I was newly diagnosed, I read 2 books that helped me understand. The first year MS A guide for newly diagnosed, and MS for Dummies. Not sure if either are available in audio format.",

SO what is MS what is INO?\nYou are still trying to separate MS and INO. They are not separate, INO and the difficulties it causes is a symptom of Multiple Sclerosis.\nI have had Multiple Sclerosis, diagnosed, for 31 years (I was diagnosed at the age of 24) with symptoms that go back to childhood. In 2014 I had my first experience with INO.\nAt this time it's only my left eye and one muscle involved, double vision is only when I look to the right. My INO has never gone away but my eyes have (somewhat) adjusted and I don't have as much trouble looking to the right. I deal with eye pain and pain above my left eye and pain at the left temple both due to the results of INO per my neuro ophthalmologist. My pain does come and go.\nI was told, and I already knew, that my INO could become worse. Any damage Multiple Sclerosis causes has the potential of getting worse --- over the long haul.\nBoth her and my neuro Op said I need to live with INO!!\nYes, this is correct. This can also be true for any symptoms caused by MS\nIf a person has relapsing/remitting MS it is possible symptoms to resolve. However, remissions can be complete (no symptoms) or partial (residual symptoms) with partial being the most common.\nLiving with MS also means (for many) living with residual symptoms and/or symptoms that come and go.\nSo if nothing helps with the internuclear ophthalmoplegia why take DMT's? To stop NEW lesions?\nI don't take a DMT and never have.\nThe DMDs/DMTs are to hopefully: slow progression of the disease, reduce lesion load, and reduce the amount and severity of exacerbations (relapse, attack, flare-up). Is it possible to have symptom improvements on a DMD/DMT? Yes, but this is not true for everyone.\nUsing a DMD/DMT is a personal decision best made as a discussion between you and your Neurologist.\nSome things for you to think about:\nIf you choose not to use a DMD/DMT and your disease course progressed or you were having relapses could you live with the past decision of not using a DMD/DMT or would you have regrets for not starting a treatment sooner?\nIf you would have regrets then you need to use a DMT/DMD.\nIn choosing not to treat you are choosing to allow your journey with this disease to take it's natural course --- good or bad.\nBest wishes on your decision",

Earlier this year, the drug reportedly \"failed\" during Phase II testing.\nAfter more careful scrutiny the drug failed for patients with a longer diagnosis period, more accumulated damage or had transitioned into a second disease state.\nFor newer patients, the drug performed much better. This isn't a surprise because all of our treatments have the same therapeutic trend lines.\nThe THRILLING news is the drug still might make it to market for many patients.

    "Post" : "Originally posted by Marco View Post\nFor newer patients, the drug performed much better.\nThat's not surprising, and it's not encouraging, either. Younger patients and those in the earlier stages of MS remyelinate better on their own than do older patients and those in later stages of MS.\nA major theory is that recoveries tend to be faster and more complete in RRMS in the early \"faster/better remyelinating\" years, and that secondary progressive develops when bodies lose their ability to remyelinate and recover with time and age.\nSo it isn't surprising that the effects of Anti-LINGO-1 (opicinumab) are better in conjunction with a body that's doing a lot of the recovery on its own anyway. The other thing that won't be surprising is that, in a body that isn't doing as much remyelinating on its own in older/later stages, the small effect of Anti-LINGO won't be enough to make any difference, and it will end up failing to help, just as it failed to help in the general group of test subjects in the clinical trial.\n20 year olds who drink soda can run faster than 70 year olds who drink soda. It isn't the soda that makes the 20 year olds faster, and it many not be Anti-LINGO that makes younger people remyelinate better than older people.\nThe \"success\" of Anti-LINGO in younger patients may be only an illusion. Even if it isn't, the clinical trials have already shown that its effectiveness is lost when bodies get older and lose their inherent ability to remyelinate. So it remains to be seen how marketable and useful it will be during that perceived window of opportunity.",

Gilenya is considered a \"second line\" treatment by some insurance companies (including mine), meaning you have to try and fail other ones first. Your neuroIogist is the one who will need to fight for you by writing an appeal. Sometimes, that works. Should always try.\nIn the meantime, call your insurance company to find out which Disease Modifying Drugs they will approve for you so you can start narrowing down your list before your appointment next week. Sometimes, you can find this info online. Google name of your insurance company and criteria for disease modifying MS therapies (or the name of the DMD.) This usually includes the \"CRAB\" drugs (Copaxone, Rebif, Avonex, Betaseron). I started on Avonex (only Betaseron, Copaxone, and Avonex were available at that time). Not saying it was any better than the other choices I had, but was my preference over the others because it was a once a week injection. But it is an interferon, and with that, alo had some flu like symptoms until my body adjusted to it.\nTysabri might a good choice if that one happens to be available.to you.

I understand a lot more now, I spent an hour asking her questions until I understood. I start Monday!! Finally.\nI talked to the Doc and she said that she had said and wrote the same things that I was told to have her write. She (my neuro) was not happy with the insurance rep. I think you (the patient) needs to talk personally to the person denying you. They need to hear the patient. That or I just got VERY lucky to get Gilenya as my first med. All I can say is just be VERY nice to them as they have the power to approve or deny you. Crazy. It was hard for me to find out the actual person denying me but was worth it. My \"patient rep\" from Novartis was NO help at all. Other than lying to me and sending me on the wrong path. Worthless they are. They sure do like to call you a lot.\nIT'S UP TO YOU! SORRY BUT YOU HAVE TO DO THIS!\nFind that person. Kiss their behind. Do what they say and GET your meds. Just my opinion.\nIf I can help you in any way please contact me. I feel sorry for the people who have to fail for years before they can even try Gilenya. Total crap. I just hope I'm not expecting too much from Gilenya.",

    "Post" : "I've had lots of steroid treatments and usually deal with the usual side effects of feeling wired, hungry all the time, insomnia, etc. Recently, I had acute onset of partial seizures which was new for me. MRI of brain and cervical spine didn't show anything new but I have significant disease in my brain stem and midbrain so my neurologist feels I have gray matter disease there causing this. Anyway, she treated me with high dose oral steroids with taper. By day 4 seizures were gone but 2 days after taper was done they were back.\nShe took me off Ampyra too in case that was culprit and increased my neurontin but neither did anything. Anyway, she went on vacation and someone else covered for her. He decided he didn't want to start a new anti seizure med because it \"may not be what my regular neurologist would want me on\". So instead he gave me 3 days of iv steroids to try to keep the seizures away til she came back. I asked to try an anti seizure med but he wanted to wait. So frustrating.\nSo I had another course of steroids just 1 1/2 weeks later with no taper. After second dose seizures stopped again but I got so sick after the third dose. Sweats, fatigue, dizzy spells, shaky, real bad gi upset so couldn't eat or get out of bed for several days. I've never had this response before. And after 5 days when these symptoms finally got better, seizures came back. Now they took my Modafinil away in case that caused them. Still no med to treat them though.\nBeen out of work 3 1/2 weeks now and no progress made. Off Ampyra and Modafinil so much harder to get around too.\nJust wondering if anyone has had this response to steroids?my lab work was checked with no big changes pre and post steroids. I think two courses of high dose steroids in short time was too much. Has anyone had treatment course like that? Anyone have seizures from MS or meds for MS and if so how was it treated? Has anyone dealt with MD coverage who just tries to get you by until regular doctor is back? Never been treated that way before either.\nI appreciate any advice, information anyone has. I'm at my wits end with all this. Hoping for some help.",

Just wondering if anyone has had this response to steroids?\nI've had many rounds of IV steroids, and several of them went just like that. All I could do was lie in bed with the room spinning. Other episodes have gone relatively well, and others have been somewhere in between. That's just how high dose steroids are. Anyone can have experiences anywhere along that spectrum.\nA couple of times I've had full steroid series only 2 weeks apart, and the second one wasn't any worse than the first. The bad rounds occurred on their own without any apparent differences from the others.\nYour bad experience with steroids may or may not have anything to do with your series being close together. Steroids are actually out of the body within just a few days, even though the side effects last a week or so longer. It's possible that the second round was just on the worse end of the side effects spectrum.\nI'm sorry to see that you had such a bad time of it. Hopefully your regular neuro can get things under control again for you, or refer you to another specialist who can. Wishing you all the best. Hang in there.",

It has helped with my strength, my walking speed is significantly better (my physical therapist says it is, too) but I really do think this might be due, at least in part, to an awful, months long relapse finally calming down.\nI was diagnosed in March, had 2 rounds of solumedrol (which maybe made me a little worse for a month or two), and am going for my 3rd tysabri infusion Friday. I still have pretty bad gait and balance issues, which my dr thinks are due to spasms, and tremor. He really wants me to take baclofen, but it makes me way too sleepy and I think it makes my tremor and balance worse. I'm taking clonazepam for the tremor, and it does help a lot, but I hate the idea that it's an addictive drug. And if I take the baclofen too, the tremor comes back.\nAnyway, I think maybe the ampyra 2x a day makes my balance worse, too. I forgot evening doses a few times and I really seemed to be better off the next day.

Since the low-dose form is not commercially available and has to be compounded, these two guidance documents shouldn't affect LDN, either.\nThe FDA may take action against compounders and compounded drugs later for other reasons, but for now, MSers taking 4-AP and LDN shouldn't have any trouble continuing to get them from compounding pharmacies.\n“Compounded Drug Products That Are Essentially Copies of Approved Drug Products” - See more at: http://www.raps.org/Regulatory-Focus....U39PTBNc.dpuf\n“Compounded Drug Products That Are Essentially Copies of Approved Drug Products” - See more at: http://www.raps.org/Regulatory-Focus....U39PTBNc.dpuf\n“Compounded Drug Products That Are Essentially Copies of Approved Drug Products” - See more at: http://www.raps.org/Regulatory-Focus....U39PTBNc.dpuf",

    "Post" : "Thanks for the reply, jreagen70. I've been on Ampyra for six years, but once I go on Medicare in February, I lose the subsidized cost of only $40 a month. I'd like to try 4-ap to see if I get the same results at the same cost. I thought Ampyra was just 4-ap turned into an extended time release formula. But from what you said, 4-ap is different enough from Ampyra to not fit in this category described in the release as an \"essential copy.\"",

    "Post" : "Hi ru4cats:\nYou're right that Ampyra is basically 4-AP in a time-released version. But it's the chemicals and the formulation causing it to be time-released that make it a \"commercially available and approved\" drug. 4-AP by itself -- not in the time-released formulation -- doesn't fit that category. So unless and until the FDA restricts compounding in another way, you should be good to go with compounded 4-AP.",

    "Post" : "On June 27, 2016, Genentech, a member of the Roche group, announced that the Biologics License Application (BLA) for ocrelizumab has been accepted for review by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This is the first time that an investigational medication is being reviewed for the treatment of two types of multiple sclerosis (MS): relapsing forms of MS (RMS) and primary-progressive MS (PPMS).\nThe FDA has also granted Priority Review Designation of the application, with a targeted action date of December 28, 2016. This means that the review of the application is expected to be completed by this date, as well as a decision on whether or not this investigational medication is approved. Genentech has submitted the brand name Ocrevus™ for use with ocrelizumab.\nIf approved, ocrelizumab would be the first medication available for both RMS and PPMS. Presently, 14 disease-modifying therapies are available for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS, but no treatments have been approved by the FDA for PPMS, which is a less-common form of the disease. PPMS is characterized by a steady accumulation of symptoms, versus sudden flare-ups and remissions.\nhttp://mymsaa.org/news/fda-accepts-review-ocrelizumab/",

I was just diagnosed last February and I'm 22 (very new to the world of MS with no doctor truly speaking to me).\nI was just given tecfidera finally and am meant to start it tomorrow. However, I believe I'm starting to have a relapse. I would call a neurologist, but mine just left and I have to wait to be referred to a new one (which in the past has taken 4+ months with state insurance).\nI'm just curious, is there any reason at all that I should wait on taking tecfidera while I am not even being monitored by a doctor AND going through a relapse? I'm afraid tec could make me very ill, and not help with my problems I'm currently going through (I'm very fatigued and going numb in all over my body, along with my eyes being affected).\nI feel scared and silly. I guess because I feel I have been kept in the dark about my own disorder (I have only met with a neuro three times, and now have no one).",

I am sorry I don't really know, I imagine it is fine to start it at any point, but I know I would also be more comfortable if I was being monitored when starting the medication. Perhaps even the pharmacist would be able to talk to you about it?\nI am on tecfidera and it was a fairly easy start for me. I read all about the side effects before I started and was prepared for the worst. It is really scary starting any new medication, but there is lots of advice out there about making sure you eat a full meal with some fat - I like to eat nut butter for breakfast with my meds. Some people also recommend taking an aspirin with your dose to help with the flushing. I had some flushing initially but it has gone away now (unless I don't eat a full meal with each dose)\nBut make sure you are doing the slow ramp up in dosing though - you should be starting with the half dose for a while.",

Tecfidera start-up effects aren't always kind and throwing that into the mix could be rough. For me, I would delay the Tecfidera because it's not going to help your flare up, it could make things worse and you don't want to have a bad start up experience with a new medication.\nI'm sorry you are in a flare, but I hope it passes soon and Tecfidera serves you well!",
