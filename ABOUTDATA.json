    "Post" : "Hi Crazyguy and welcome the the boards! Sounds like you have found answers for some conditions and are hanging by the limbs on other symptoms. I'm sorry to hear - it must be very frustrating.\nI have had vertigo and spasticity (still do), but nothing else that you describe. Oops, memory problems too, but that also comes with aging -lol.\nGood luck with your next neuro appt. Is this neuro an MS specialist? Hope you can get to the bottom of all your problems! MS is hard to diagnose, in that they rule out other conditions first.\nPlease take care and let us know what your next appt. finds, if anything.",

My wife has told me my legs shake while I’m sleeping for about 5-7 seconds at a time. He seems to think that I have restless legs syndrome even though it went away when they started me on the seizure meds for the TN.\nI feel like I’m talking to a wall when I bring up MS because he won’t even entertain the possibility since I’m not showing lesions.\nThe sleep study only only showed that I have sleep apnea. They want me to come in for a second study to test a cpap. The weird thing is that they didn’t make me stop the seizure meds to do these tests.\nI cant help but feel I’m getting inadequate care. I’ve though even I’ve told them my previous psychiatrist suggested that I might have a neurologic disease.",

Unfortunately my doctors are standing firm on the no MS thing and haven’t been able to convince them to give me a LP.\nThere is no single test, by it's self, that can give a diagnosis of MS. For this reason MS can be difficult to diagnose. A LP is usually one of the last tests to be given as it is quite invasive and a negative LP does not rule MS out.\nAs I said in an earlier post the diagnostic criteria relies heavily on MRI evidence and since you don't have lesions the medical thought is you don't have MS, so why do an invasive? (right or wrong). Lesions are a hallmark of this disease, however not all lesions are MS type lesions. Other conditions can cause lesions.\nHere is a link to some of those other conditions that mimic MS:\nhttps://www.nationalmssociety.org/Sy...ns-to-Rule-Out\nIf you did not have a spine MRI done then I would suggest asking the Neurologist about doing one. MS is a disease of the Central Nervous System(CNS), which includes the brain, optic nerves, and spinal cord. Lesions can and do show up anywhere within the CNS. I would suggest the spine MRI before even doing a LP.",

I know not showing lesions means it’s a slim chance that I do have MS. The main reason I believe I do have it is that my mom has MS. I know it sounds crazy but I think I’ve had it since I was a kid.\nIve had a psychotic disorder since I was 18. I’ve read that early onset MS can cause seizures and normal exams as well as psychotic disorders. When I was 10 I used to get intense stomach pain that my GP couldn’t figure out. In my teens I used to sleep all day and couldnt get out of bed. One time I thought I had pancreatitis cause of these pains and could even keep water down for a week. I guessing this could be from a lesion on my brain stem controlling my stomach. I also remember going camping with friends when I was 16 and they told me my legs shook in my sleep.\nI agree that there are more tests they could have done like evoked potentials. This neuro I’m seeing is supposed to be a pretty good one. I just hope he can find something.",

Magnet strength is measured in Tesla (T).\nMost conventional MRI machines are 1.5T or 3T.\nOpen MRIs are usually less than 1.5T and do not provide the best images for detecting MS activity, although they may be used when someone has difficulty tolerating a closed MRI machine.\nMRI machines used for research purposes have much higher magnet strength.\"\nhttps://www.nationalmssociety.org/Sy...-Diagnosis/MRI\nTake Care",

But this was also while I was in the middle of a psychotic episode. My psychiatrist who I’ve been seeing for some time told me I definitely don’t have that. So I guess that could be a bit of paranoia.\nMy previous neurologist thinks I have bppv. And like you, only did 1 15 minute exam and MRIs only on a 1.5 Tesla. My second neurologist was horrible and only did a few tests and said since my MRI was normal that I don’t have MS. My current neuro I have some confidence in. He says it’s at least possible to have a normal MRI although it is unlikely. He is leaving no stone unturned. I have an appointment next week with an ENT, and a 2 hour EEG. He did an MRI of my middle and lower back on a 3T machine. I currently waiting on the results for that.\nI have been doing PT for my balance and dizziness which is helping. And he thinks the problem is vestibular but not BPPV.\nSo far no one has pulled the mental health card on me and they recognize my symptoms as organic but don’t think they are from a single source like MS. My psychologist has been encouraging me to get more answers and even referred me to my current neuro. So I don’t she she would do that if this was “all in my head”.\nI should be getting some results from my doctor soon so I will keep everyone posted.",

I have been far from home working on the house of a relative and sleeping on a couch - definitely gets me into the convenience/comfort foods. That your diet and lifestyle influence your symptoms is definitely something to mention to your neurologist. It’s great that you recognize that and know what you need to do - even though it’s not easy.",

I have only seen my G.P .... he mostly addresses each individual issues and puts allot down to stress.\nI did see another GP last year, that was more about a second opinion on another issue I've been having - abdominal cramps ... not colic, not stomach cramps, but abdominal cramps, its the muscle cramping up - I can feel it sometimes goes all the way around to the back, although I don't feel it at the sides like a band so I don't think its the hug thing ... I saw a physio and have stretching exercises for that and that helps ... it comes and goes. I tried to explain the other stuff going on to this new GP but you only get 15 minutes so its hard, especially if they are not currently active issues. He said he could do a CAT scan but since the exercises help and it comes and goes I haven't done that ... maybe I should ? Wouldn't an MRI be better ?\nAnyway I guess I'll just wait and see what happens over the next month or so and go back and ask for a referral to a neurologist .. or find a another GP and start over. The numbness on the left leg went away so I guess it might also disappear on the right side .. in a funny way I want it to get worse so I can finally work out what is going on and get some kind of diagnosis Good idea about making a timeline.

When I look it up, it is called pallesthesia and is not necessarily linked to MS. Most MS sensations say tingling or burning. I was just curious as this is a new one for me, but search results seem to imply it is not uncommon in general.\nTo describe, it feels like a quick vibration in my left foot, maybe 2-3 seconds, and then it goes away for 5-10 seconds.

Numbness is divided into four categories:\n• Paresthesia – feelings of pins and needles, tingling, buzzing, or crawling sensation\n• Dysesthesia – a burning sensation along a nerve; changes in perceptions of touch or pressure; nonpainful contact becomes painful\n• Hyperpathia – increased sensitivity to pain\n• Anesthesia – complete loss of any sensation, including touch, pain, or temperature\nhttps://mymsaa.org/ms-information/symptoms/numbness/\nTake Care",

Glad to meet you, I'm a secondary progressive too. Good attitude? Yes, and it's difficult, but I want to keep going. Tell me more about your travel scooter...is it something that can ride on a bus with you? Kinda like a wheelchair? I'm thinking about this for the future, I'm still able to ambulate pretty well. A shopping cart borrowed from the market close to where I live is the best thing I've found so far. I still have the idea that I could ride a bicycle. May well be a lost dream, the bike would be best since the bus has a bike rack on the front, and since I drove in transit for ten years before I got diagnosed, I have a free pass. Where a wheelchair is concerned, I'm hesitant to go that direction, whether a free pass or not, it's an unfair use of a driver's time. I don't want to burden the system that way. Mind you I don't take a shopping cart on the bus...still looking around for something that will travel on the bus that takes the place of the shopping cart.\nWell this appears to have gotten a bit scrambled, so I will end here and look for yours and any other replies.

My smaller,lighter scooter is called the Shoprider Echo 3 wheeled mobility scooter. My big scooter is called the Golden Buzzaround XL 4 wheel scooter. I also have a folding walker that has 4 wheels and a small pouch under the flip up seat for a bit of storage. The walker is easily folded and is light. The scooters would be too large to load on a city bus. They are meant to either be ridden to your destination or transported by car for the most part. A walker could be carried up the steps of a city bus and folded and stored beside you in a seat. Here in my town there are buses specifically for persons with disabilities that have wheelchair lifts installed and drivers who are trained to assist the riders. I understand your feelings of burdening the system but disabled folks need to get around too and in my experience most people are very kind and willing to help. Again please feel free to ask me any questions that you may have! Always happy to help if I can.",

I appreciate your concerns about burdening transit. Unfortunately, we in this part of the world have a fair amount of abusers. When I was able to drive, I did my level best to accommodate everyone that rolled up to a bus stop in a scooter, or wheelchair. It did pay off...more than once I met a person that I had transported in my wheelie bus (wheelchair transport van) on another job. People that were so happy to see me roll up in that 40 foot long monster and know the person driving it!\nAnd after the bus filled up completely, and could not hold another person, wheelchair or not, and find the goof that started spewing ADA regulation and \"I'll call a lawyer\" in alternating screeches, I just shook my head and gave him a card with the contact number and my bus number, and went on.\nThe office found it in their hearts to send a supervisor to get him a ride on a different bus and all was well.\nEvery day there is some good and bad, the trick is to make it good for as many people as possible.",

I really found this interesting because I've not read any discussion of any sort of condition relating to this, here or anywhere else, at least that I can remember right at the moment.\nI'm still here, hunting for anything I can find positive, even remotely.

Somewhere in this long and rambling series of messages, I indicate a lack of faith in medicine. Boy, did that one ever get more evident. Most recent doctoring event was an annual site visit. First one that I can remember, but that's not important right now. The insurance company that has my medicare supplement sent a doctor. I found his info, and just about fell on the floor. Nice gentleman, might have an idea of medical stuff, physician search says \"general surgeon\". Okay, gonna amputate this MS thing, eh? He's 93 years of age, drove himself here, has an office (allegedly, I have no idea where this office might be.) In all honesty I had to be impressed that a doctor, who did his first residency at The University of Cincinnati Medical Center the year that I was born, is still able to practice, keep certified, etc. etc. etc.\nShort story getting too long, all he needed to find is that I have blood pressure, and can somewhat move around. I pass!\nOn a brighter note I have discs with MRI images that I took dating back to 2011. The quest to find a neuro continues. Other news and changes may well show up in another post on another board here. For now, I have to view this as a positive, even though a doctor without a clue (MS who?) is sent to see me, and only fill in the blanks in a spreadsheet.\nNot giving up, but I still need to find better ways of managing this stupid disease. I don't post too often here, but I use as many words as I can come up with when I do come in here.",

    "Post" : "Another year...\nI saw my post from March of 2018, and it made me sad. I've just used another of dwindling years to learn how to live with this disease. Anyone who thinks it easy, just envision difficulties with things like trips to the porcelain altar in the middle of the night and such as that. Finally after all this time, I get the feeling that I've got it figured out. First, and most important, there is no middle of night. Just another interruption of sleep. Now just roll with the punches, they will not stop, but if they do it may well be a bad sign. Getting everyday activities of like these have been accomplishments I've done by myself. Because most people who say they would like to help with them have no clue. It is assumed that I already have done it.\nGoing forward, it is another learning experience that no one can really help me with, since they automatically assume that I've got it under control. This is how do I continue functioning while being completely run down all the time. Get out the rear view mirror and see that I have done this, successfully for a long time.\nNow, today we can interject this coronavirus debacle. I've done some of this, expressed my feelings about things and got suspended from twitter for it. One account; I have two, so no problem. I can still spew anytime I want to there. But, just in time to coincide with spring time weather, when I should be out there moving around, here comes micromanaging governamental types saying \"stay safe, stay home\". Absolutely the last thing I needed. Oh, and be sure to wear your mask. I refuse to wear a mask. I am confident that I have the antibodies, I believe that I have not had the flu since 1981, which is when I had mono which spawned MS in my case. Now, how could I prove this?\nSo I press on, with the goal of getting mobile. All of this virus crap represents just another in a long line of hurdles that I have to clear. And it's cost a considerable amount of time but I'm still here. It is well advertised that \"MS keeps people from moving\". I'm gonna be the poster child for getting over the hurdles. Keep moving, it may not happen overnight but make it happen. And learn things along the way too.\nMaybe I sound positive here, and many friends have called me a dreamer because of this. It does not hurt to dream. Only to wake up and find that it was only a dream. I don't sleep much, and that may be a good thing after all.\nDave Hall",

    "Post" : "[QUOTE=Dave Hall;1524742]\nOriginally posted by Dave Hall View Post\n...since I communicated here. In process of digging through the layers of paper that accumulate, I find some interesting stuff that didn't get read at a proper time; such as when seeing a doctor about eye problems. My vision being doubled is why I can't have a driver license, and I used to drive for a living. Not fun. This diplopia is what got me to an ophthalmologist in the first place, resulting in \"finding\" cataracts, and subsequent surgeries to repair these.\nI dunno if this doctor can read, but I can and I should have told this doc to look at the chart from my initial diagnosis. I have what is called a skew deviation. Also known as strabismus. Never heard of this, and the causes include cerebellar and brain stem stroke. Which \"can be\" secondary to MS.\nThings that make ya go: Hmmm...\nI've come back from the pile again. This has been a few years running, and as updates go, more news that's not fit to print. Somewhere in this long and rambling series of messages, I indicate a lack of faith in medicine. Boy, did that one ever get more evident. Most recent doctoring event was an annual site visit. First one that I can remember, but that's not important right now. The insurance company that has my medicare supplement sent a doctor. I found his info, and just about fell on the floor. Nice gentleman, might have an idea of medical stuff, physician search says \"general surgeon\". Okay, gonna amputate this MS thing, eh? He's 93 years of age, drove himself here, has an office (allegedly, I have no idea where this office might be.) In all honesty I had to be impressed that a doctor, who did his first residency at The University of Cincinnati Medical Center the year that I was born, is still able to practice, keep certified, etc. etc. etc.\nShort story getting too long, all he needed to find is that I have blood pressure, and can somewhat move around. I pass!\nOn a brighter note I have discs with MRI images that I took dating back to 2011. The quest to find a neuro continues. Other news and changes may well show up in another post on another board here. For now, I have to view this as a positive, even though a doctor without a clue (MS who?) is sent to see me, and only fill in the blanks in a spreadsheet.\nNot giving up, but I still need to find better ways of managing this stupid disease. I don't post too often here, but I use as many words as I can come up with when I do come in here.\nWell, I am back, again with a laundry list of stuff to pontificate on. I dunno if anyone would have a clue of how to keep up with my scatterbrain, and if you can please reply somehow. We can both find some clues.\nI am torn. I would love getting on my bicycle, get on the Route 1 Turfway bus, go to the transit center and just freelance from there, but here in NKY, we are quarantined by some \"virus\" thing. Talk to me about viri, I have the anti bodies thanks to EBV to just about any virus I could find. I've not even had the flu since 1981. Still, I get stuck at home; if it were not for Doordash, I would have starved to death a long time ago. Even managed to get the rent paid so as to have running water, heat and a/c with internet access reliably for some time.\nGoing forward, what can I do? The bus says: Essential trips only. Any restraunt within a mile of me says: Drive through or pick up only. Maybe I get a car? Cannot afford it. Curb side pick up? Yep, need bicycle and backpack (I have these).\nEvery state in the union says \"One functioning eye is required to pass eye test. Daytime driving only.\" Might work, I don't like expressways anyway. Thanks to my skew deviation, my pupils no longer react to light. So, if the sun is up, I put on dark goggles? Along with my mandated face diaper, I look like a thief.\nNeedful to say at this point; I am frustrated, and jaded. Every time I get to a point that I think I can get out of \"the comfort zone\" and move forward, something else comes to anchor me down. I have not given up, just keep jumping over hurdles, and after I clear one, there's another. I'm surviving on two hours or less of sleep now, I'm not real sure how much longer I'm gonna last. On a brighter note (!) Doordash is delivering stuff that helps me sleep a little. So far so good!",

I posted this on a large glass of Kentucky Straight Bourbon, maybe that was obvious. Now that I have run out of it, I am wide awake, but not much more coherent.

I can't afford a car, food clothing and shelter at the same time. It became a best bang for a buck item to \"live on the rails\", bicycle to travel between stations and long stay hotels, and balance these two items carefully. I did in the past drive some incredible long road trips, then went to work in public transit. Never really liked long road trips, a couple hours in and I got tired, or bored. Driving in transit was nothing like a long road trip, a long route was an hour or two one way, layover long enough for a piddle stop and a sandwich, then an hour or two back the other way. I loved that!\nCall this a dream for retirement. Given that bills are never gonna stop going up, and my pension is never gonna go up, the reality is I have to live cheap. There has to be an answer. And I will keep going.\nDave",

    "Post" : "I can relate\nHi Tinglehands.\nWelcome to MSWorld! Tingling in my right hand is my oldest symptoms. It started 30 years ago. I did have an episode of vertigo, which seemed to affect my cognitive focus 3 years after the tingling started. Then nothing for another 13 years. I was finally diagnosed 16 years after the tingling started. I had brain lesions and numerous lesions C2-C6.\nI have no leg symptoms. I had some numbness during a relapse, but it resolved. My hand tingling has progressed to full right arm numbness, which sometimes feels like I have a fully inflated blood pressure cuff on. My other symptoms I struggled with were cognitive and fatigue. But anyone who doesn't know me, would never guess, other than think I am clumsy, as I drop things constantly with the right hand. I have been trying to learn to do more left handed.\nI did struggle some with balance a few years back, but worked with PT. They said legs were fine, just needed to work on combination of vestibular therapy tied to physical movement. It resolved.\nEveryone's path with MS is different. I wish I had been diagnosed earlier, wonder if I had started on a DMT earlier, would I have progressed? I will never know. I stabilized once I started on Tysabri.\nStay active, eat healthy. Have you tried any PT for your hand? I do some exercises to try and maintain the dexterity I still have. Is it possible to play tennis, just at a less competitive level than you are used to? I played volleyball and missed it, but I couldn't serve or spike like I used to. So I played in a fun league for years.\nI am curious, did your neuro say MS treatment medications are too aggressive or is that your personal thought? If you don't mind me asking, when you say your diagnosis was changed to progressive, was it changed to PPMS or SPMS, or something else?\nAside from the tingling expanding, my MS appeared to lay dormant for 13 years before another relapse. 30 years out, I am grateful to be where I am.\nLots of luck to you.",

Initially my doc leaned toward recurring MS but failed to consider my history of slow progression starting in the finger tips and moving into the hand and wrist. Currently it is bilateral but within the last 2 weeks I have had a strange Sensation in my right bicep and upper arm like a cramp with a bicep tear. Arm is still fully functional. My doc said it was unrelated. He has not made a distinction between PPMS and SPMS. Keep in mind that I have not lost the use of my hands. I only have the numbness/tingling and burning while maintaining full functionality. I could play tennis, but as you say, not at the competitive level I like to. I still golf twice a week and am retired at 68 years of age. The doc did say that the normal MS protocol in my case at this point would be too aggressive and possibly be more harmful than helpful. I will be getting another MRI next year to check for additional lesions.\nthanks for your input.",

    "Post" : "Welcome back, Luke. Thanks for the reintroduction. It looks like you've been a member here for awhile, but just started posting again the last couple of months. I appreciate knowing your history.\n((Sigh)). Yeah, disability. Tough subject. Ya know, most of us who go on disability don't want to take that step. Sometimes the stereotype that the public might hold about us is that we're just a bunch of slackers who don't want to work. But, in my experience, that's seldom the case. You said that your wife and your parents want you to go on disability. What are their reasons for those feelings? Do they see some challenges for you that indicate maybe it's time?\nHere's my story.\nI'm 58 now. My MS started in 2002, with a bang. After multiple ER visits and hospitalizations following a stroke-like incident which was actually my first MS flare, I had to take 8 months off (two more flares, with very different symptoms, during those months). I lost my job.\nLike you, I wanted to get back to work. I opened a licensed day care home which I did for about a year and a half. Another major flare, another job loss, another 8 months off of work.\nHubby wanted me, both times, to get on disability. But, after I recovered, I got another job, this time as a para in a school district. I worked there for 4 years. I struggled, too, with staying awake on the job, but it was in the afternoons during down time when I was working alone and others likely didn't notice the catnups I took because they weren't around to view it. And, every year, I had one or two flares and multiple times off of work and had to use FMLA leave 3 years in a row. When, the fourth year, I applied for FMLA again, I lost this job.\nIt was at this point (in 2008), that I realized that, maybe, I wasn't very employable anymore. I applied for SSDI disability.. I worked hard at my application, adding all the details that I believed would help my case. Three doctors (PCP, psychologist, neurologist) recommended that I needed to go on disability. I was approved quickly, due probably to my 3 job losses which indicated my desire to stay working, my doctors' recommendations, and many many medical records. After my approval, I was also still eligible to apply for LTD (long term disability) from my job which I also received. Soon, it will convert to a retirement benefit for me.\nI grieved giving up my career. But, I truly believe that it was time. Falling asleep at work makes it sound like it might be time for you.\nA disability income allows you the freedom to choose what you want to do with your time. You could even work part time, if you take care to keep your income below the required level. For, many years, I did a significant amount of volunteering in the community (5-15 hours a week). I was able to start exercising and getting enough rest and taking care of myself better.\nIt might be time for you to move on. If not, I wish you the best in keeping your job. But I encourage you to consider your options, talk to your family and weigh the pros and cons.\nWishing you the best.",

    "Post" : "Hi there!\nFrom my personal experience, I've decided to keep the diagnosis mostly private. My symptoms are not very viable, so I have that luxury.\nAbout maybe 15 people in my life know about the diagnosis, and some of those I told early on and I regret it.\nAt first, I kept the diagnosis very secret with only a handful of people knowing. I find that there is a fine balance. I've struggled a lot with the diagnosis and allowing myself the freedom to tell a few friends really eased my mental turmoil. It was surprising how liberating it was to talk about it and now I don't feel the need to tell more people.\nAs much as I would love to trust the fairness of the system, I know that employers have the potential to hold bias against people they don't feel will be as competent as another potential employees, so I am also hesitant to announce \"to the world\" about my diagnosis.\nI also took Tecfidera and I know it works well for many. For me, I had to switch to Tysabri after a year. There's lots of advice out there about how to avoid flushing with Tecfidera (I read a lot of message boards!). The most important thing to remember is to never take it on an empty stomach. I felt eating a meal with fat in the morning was the most helpful for me. I would usually eat a pretty normal breakfast for me, and then also eat a scoop of natural peanut putter as well.",

    "Post" : "Welcome Panache. Glad you found us.\nIt takes a little while to get used to a diagnosis and can sometimes be an emotional roller coaster ride. At least it was for me.\nI am not familiar with Canadian employment laws. In the US, we have protection laws, but even then, sometimes discrimination may occur. So here, they recommend not disclosing unless you need to ask for an accomodation to do your job. Even then, you don't need to disclose, just have a doctor's note stating you have a medical condition, and need a specific accomodation(s) to do your job.\nI did disclose when having trouble completing my work and had multiple short term disability leaves. I had asked for an accomodation, providing a flexible work schedule from home, with longer mid day breaks,when needed. The doctors request did not say MS, but I verbally told my boss, his boss, and my teammates about my diagnosis. I had impacted some key project dates that they were all taking heat on, so I felt I owed them the truth. This occurred 8 years after diagnosis and 21 years after first relapse.\nIf you are not sure, check into Canadian protection laws. If you are showing symptoms, but aren't sure about disclosing and people ask, you can always say you are under a doctor's care and testing, just not letting on you have an answer.\nGood luck with Tecfidera and welcome again!",

    "Post" : "Thank you all for your kind responses!\nIt is a very scary time right now, not knowing for sure what these new symptoms mean. Are they new Fibro problems? MS? Something entirely different?\nI feel relieved to know that the electric shocks I have experienced are not Lhermitte's Sign. That and the facial numbness and burning have me worried the most. In my mind the rest can be attributed to illnesses or problems I have already been diagnosed with.\nI'm very sure everyone here knows the frustration and pain of trying to figure out what is going on with our bodies. Since May I have honestly thought I was losing my mind on more than one occasion.\nI have raged and cried many times, especially over my eye sight. I was all but promised that my vision would be so vastly improved that I may no longer even need my glasses. Instead, the opposite happened and I can no longer drive at night and many days battle double vision.\nI ask myself almost every day if these surgeries were needed at all or if the symptoms were strictly part of whatever is going on with me now? I wonder how skilled an ophthalmologist would or should be in knowing if symptoms like double vision are truly an \"eye\" problem or a \"brain\" problem?\nI had what I thought was an excellent surgeon for my cataract surgeries but ended up nearly arguing with him (and truly arguing with his nurse) that I was battling doubled, blurry vision as well as vision that kept decreasing with every visit. I kept being told that while yes, he could tell I was truly seeing double and my vision was obviously worsening, that no, it wasn't due to his surgeries because those were \"perfect and healed nicely.\" I just still needed \"time to heal\" and my vision could improve \"any day now.\"\nA second surgeon took out my floaters and for a brief amount of time, my daytime vision was amazing, but it didn't take long for the double vision to return. This surgeon pretty much informed me that at my age and the facts that my cataracts were tiny, I should probably have never had the first surgeries. He admitted to being at a lost as to why my vision was worsening instead of improving.\nSome days I feel like those first surgeries caused everything else that has followed.",

    "Post" : "it's been a while...time for an update that basically isn't an update\nHello all,\nI hope you are all doing well and staying healthy in this storm called COVID-19.\nI had my lumbar puncture which came back clear. So far that means I've had:\nBlood work that came back fine.\nBrain MRI that came back with lesions not typical for MS, but with physical deficits noted by Neurologist, MS cannot be excluded.\nLumbar Puncture that came back normal. (Lumbar was done before MRI/spine after a discussion with my Neurologist)\nWhat this means for me now is that as soon as it is clear for me to do so, I will have the MRI/spine done and if that comes back normal or inconclusive I will be seeing an MS specialist at IU.\nIn the meantime, things calmed down for a bit and a lot of my symptoms either died off or calmed down to a much milder level of discomfort.\nThis past week has seen most of them ramp up again including a newer sensation of repeated electrical shocks in my feet and left hand. The muscle weakness is returning to full strength as well.\nAs far as my eyesight: I don't know whether the first surgeon was competent or not. The second surgeon did feel like the cataract surgery was done too soon, BUT it did enable me to have the floater surgeries which he would not have done had I not had cataract surgery already(getting rid of the floaters was AMAZING and I am glad to have done it.)\nHaving said that, the double vision and blurriness is what SENT me to the specialists and was not an after-effect of the surgeries. The loss of night vision was the only after-effect.\nIt's funny because I remember when I was trying to figure out what was wrong with me 7 years ago and they were testing for all sorts of things, I was told it might take years to get a dx. Within 6 months I was dx-ed with Fibromyalgia and started on meds that made a huge difference in my life.\nI guess I expected the same thing here because of that situation. It is just so hard to wrap my head around the fact that something that has changed my life entirely could remain in hiding for so long before we know what is causing it.",

If you spine MRI comes back normal you do not have any testing indicating MS. Without testing that indicates MS a diagnosis will not be given. A Multiple Sclerosis Specialist can be difficult to get into especially without any testing indicating MS. The Neurology Practice I go to doesn't even accept new patients without a Doctors referral.\nYour brain MRI has lesions not indicative for MS. The lesions you do have can be due to age, your migraines or Fibro.\nMany things can cause double or blurry vision including general vision problems;\nhttps://www.eyeworld.org/article-dou...uble--diplopia\nhttps://stanfordhealthcare.org/medic...on/causes.html\nEye floaters are, for the most part, considered normal -- unless there is a (diagnosed) serious cause. I have lived with floaters since I was a kid -- mine are normal. My daughter has also experienced floaters and they are normal. Eye floaters are not caused by Multiple Sclerosis.\nIf your cataracts were not \"ready\" (large) to be removed then the eye surgeon should not have removed them. I have (both eyes) congenital cataracts (born with them) and I am almost 59 years old. I tried to find an eye surgeon that would remove them when I was in my late 20s - mid 30s. As each one told me they would not do the surgery I finally decided I was putting my own health at risk by continuing to find that \"one\" surgeon who would perform the surgery. I am so glad I did not have cataract surgery, there are many risks to it regardless of age.\nbeen to ER twice for concerns of heart attack (banded pressure around my chest and arms) that were diagnosed as panic attacks\nHave you been to the Dr. to see about having your anxiety/panic attacks treated? If not I would suggest doing so. Anxiety/panic attacks can cause body wide physical symptoms. If treated you might find an improvement with symptoms.",

    "Post" : "I appreciate the kindness I have been shown by most, but I think that it may be time for me to say goodbye.\nI still hope I am misunderstanding this poster's tone and intention but every response to me leaves me feeling angry, belittled and as though the poster thinks I am quite stupid. I almost didn't come back and post my last followup for those very reasons but thought I would give it one more shot.\nI have faced disbelief countless times when people hear that I have Fibro. I have even had a doctor look me in the eyes and say he doesn't believe in it at all, so I have had plenty of time to get used to that, but I really thought that a forum like this would be different and show nothing but love and support. I just don't feel that it's healthy to continue to post someplace when as soon as you hit send, you start waiting for the debate you know is going to come out of it.\nI am not trying to start a battle with this poster, but I do hope by giving one last response that the poster might look at how they address people and stop and think about how their words come across to others\nOriginally posted by SNOOPY View Post\nWhy? If you spine MRI comes back normal you do not have any testing indicating MS. Without testing that indicates MS a diagnosis will not be given. A Multiple Sclerosis Specialist can be difficult to get into especially without any testing indicating MS. The Neurology Practice I go to doesn't even accept new patients without a Doctors referral.\nYour brain MRI has lesions not indicative for MS. The lesions you do have can be due to age, your migraines or Fibro.\nWhy??? Unless you are a doctor and have seen my MRI, how do you know what they are or are not indicative of? I obviously WILL have a doctor's referral to an MS specialist as my current neurologist is concerned with my Neurological testing and has stated that there is definitely something wrong with me.\nI guess maybe I'm a little confused when doctors tell me this is going to be a long journey and that things can change from one scan to the next why you are so certain that I should just stop after an MRI/Spine and accept that my symptoms are just all in my head?\nMany things can cause double or blurry vision including general vision problems;\nhttps://www.eyeworld.org/article-dou...uble--diplopia\nhttps://stanfordhealthcare.org/medic...on/causes.html\nI am aware of this. I am also aware that it is ALSO often one of the first symptoms of MS.\nEye floaters are, for the most part, considered normal -- unless there is a (diagnosed) serious cause. I have lived with floaters since I was a kid -- mine are normal. My daughter has also experienced floaters and they are normal. Eye floaters are not caused by Multiple Sclerosis.\nAGAIN, I am aware of this. But again you assume to know my situation and make comments arguing my statements. My floaters were very large and causing major issues. The doctor who removed them did so for that reason and the result of having them removed was amazing. I never claimed that my floaters were a symptom of MS. You read that into my words all on your own.\nIf your cataracts were not \"ready\" (large) to be removed then the eye surgeon should not have removed them. I have (both eyes) congenital cataracts (born with them) and I am almost 59 years old. I tried to find an eye surgeon that would remove them when I was in my late 20s - mid 30s. As each one told me they would not do the surgery I finally decided I was putting my own health at risk by continuing to find that \"one\" surgeon who would perform the surgery. I am so glad I did not have cataract surgery, there are many risks to it regardless of age.\nI don't even know how to respond. Honestly, the first thought that came to my mind was \"Well, DUH!\" Hind sight is 20/20 (even though my vision is not). I trusted a doctor I should not have trusted but I will restate this again: the vision problems that *MIGHT* be MS related were there before the surgery and remain after the surgery. Yes, they might not have anything to do with MS at all, but they are a possible symptom and three doctors have all advised me that in the grand scheme of things....they matter.\nHave you been to the Dr. to see about having your anxiety/panic attacks treated? If not I would suggest doing so. Anxiety/panic attacks can cause body wide physical symptoms. If treated you might find an improvement with symptoms.\nIf I can repeat myself...again, I know this. I had two panic attacks over the course of a summer that included four separate eye surgeries. I am not overly prone to panic or anxiety.\nYou know, the way I look at it is like this. I DON'T WANT to have MS. No one does. But I also don't WANT to keep having undiagnosed symptoms that are making my life quite miserable. I WANT answers. I DON'T WANT to have to over explain things to people. I WANTED to be a part of a community that uplifts and encouraged and shares. Darn it, maybe I even WANTED to hear, \"Yeah, I had all that too and it ended up not being MS but something much easier to deal with.\"\nI didn't want to feel foolish or like I am forced to defend every statement I make just because someone believes that they know me or the things I am going through. I've spent years doing that already with Fibro and the thought scares me out of my mind that people might look at me the same way now when I KNOW that something is not right.\nLook, I'm sorry if I have you pegged wrong, but maybe you might stop and think about the way you respond to others. I know that right now I personally feel rotten because of the continued way you have responded to me.",

    "Post" : "Hello diguilio,\nI am sorry to hear of your struggles with this disease. I was officially diagnosed 13 years ago and my Dr. suspected I may have had MS 8 years earlier. I believe I had MS way earlier given the physical issues I had. Now I am secondary progressive, have to have a brace on one foot and walk slowly with a cane. My balance is terrible, I have bad muscle cramps and spasticity and lucky me, two other autoimmune issues, hyperthyroidism and lymphocytic colitis along with other ailments that old guys get.\nWhile it may sound cliche, I live by the motto I may have MS but MS doesn't have me. I try to stay positive even on days when I am not doing well. On those days when I am very clumsy and have difficulty moving, I still try and do something around the house even if it is only for 10 minutes. I still enjoy working in the yard or working on my old truck so I will work on something for a few minutes and tend to push myself and when I notice my foot is dragging and I am losing my balance it is back to my chair where I sit and watch TV with my cat purring on my lap.\nMy cat Missy Moo is my therapy cat. I got her just a few months after I was diagnosed and she really is calming, unless she wants to go outside at 4:30 in the morning!\nSo while I don't know much about your situation and what you are dealing with, I can only offer advice on what has worked for me. Having an activity that you enjoy, even if it is only for a few minutes at a time, is helpful as I think it allows you to focus on something other than this nasty disease. My therapy cat has also been a big help as she is entertaining and seems to know my moods and when I am not doing well she climbs on my lap and starts purring and takes a nap which is calming for me.\nAs others have said, one day at a time, that's all any of us can do. I hope you are able to find a distraction from MS. For me, having a distraction such as working in my garden or on my old truck, allows me to think about something else other than my medical issues.\nPlease feel free to check back in and if you are up to providing more specific information on what you are dealing with, there are many folks here that can provide some good advice.\nTake care!",

Find activities you enjoy.

Pamper yourself sometimes. That goes along with finding activities you enjoy, but also just stop to de-stress. Consider deep breathing, mindfulness, meditation, yoga, etc. Get some exercise, but listen to your body and don't over-do it.

Causes of constipation include:\n-Insufficient fluid intake\n-Reduced physical activity and mobility\n-Decreased or slowed “motility” (movement of food through the intestinal tract)\n-Side effects of certain medications\nLoss of bowel control in MS could be neurologic in origin (or related to constipation) and should be evaluated by your MS provider.\nBowel regularity\nA healthcare provider can help establish an effective bowel management program. Occasionally, it might be necessary to consult a gastroenterologist, a physician specializing in the stomach and bowel.\nBowel regularity generally can be maintained by following a few simple suggestions:\n-Drink adequate amounts of fluids — at least 48 ounces (6 to 8 glasses) of fluids daily.\n-Include plenty of fiber in your diet. Fiber can be obtained from fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grain breads and cereals, and dietary additives such as powdered psyllium preparations.\n-Get some physical activity. It helps keep things moving.\n-Establish a regular time and schedule for emptying the bowels (bowel training/retraining).\nDiscuss remedies such as stool softeners, bulk forming supplements, enemas, suppositories or manual stimulation with your healthcare provider. It may take several weeks to know if these remedies are working. Continuous or regular use of laxatives is generally not recommended.\nhttps://www.nationalmssociety.org/Sy...Bowel-Problems\nYou'll find also this discussed in the The Secretive and Confidential Room:\nhttps://www.msworld.org/forum/forumd...l-Symptom-Room\nHere are some threads about constipation:\nhttps://www.msworld.org/forum/showth...2-Constipation!\nhttps://www.msworld.org/forum/showth...2-Constipation\nhttps://msworld.org/forum/showthread...on-please-help!!\nBest wishes",

    "Post" : "Thank you all for the welcome responses. Sorry, it took me a bit to respond again. I've had a lot of mental fog since the beginning of the year and am as easily distracted as a dog watching a squirrel.\nSeasha - I have had that thought and if I ever did start teaching a yoga class, it would definitely be something specific like that. My daughter has scoliosis so I thought about a specialized class for that too. I have a lot of ideas and passion about a lot of things but as you all I am sure are more than aware; sometimes you don't have the concentration or energy for it. I hope the Lemtrada helps with that.\npennstater & Mamabug- I don't follow the Dr. Swank diet anymore specifically. I still don't drink regular milk and only eat cheese on pizza so my saturated fat intake is still way down from what it was and my cholesterol is lower now then it was in my 20s. After the Dr. Swank book, I read a book called the Gold Coast Cure which was/is basically an updated version of Dr. Swank's book. Then about 5 years ago I read Dr. Wahls book, the Wahls' Protocol. That's what I tend to follow now but how close I stick to it varies. I just started seeing a new functional medicine doctor who would like me to follow her level 2 diet. With three other people in the house with various likes and dislikes, it gets hard but I can't blame it all on that. Sometimes it's just hard to be disciplined. I've also done various complimentary or \"alternative\" medical therapies (massage, cranial sacral, accupunture, Chinese herbs, and I guess you can throw yoga in there). And I am counting on some more medical advances to get me to 2100.\nKoKo - Thank you for reading the blog. I do hope it helps someone and yes, we are Tigers fans. My husband and I both grew up in the Detroit area. I followed the team more as a kid but my husband is still a big baseball fan so we catch games here and there.\njersey4ever - I am glad that Ocrevus is working for you. I agree that it's hard to stick to things when you have other appetites in the house to consider. I also agree that it doesn't hurt to be healthier. The first thought I had when I read the Dr. Swank book was that it's basically the diet the American Heart Association was recommending at the time. If all we did was eliminated processed foods, we would be better off. I really believe that's one of the reason we have so many autoimmune diseases now.\nThanks again for your responses.

I'm starting to believe that I was SPMS when I was diagnosed in 2009. Just lived most of a life with it. Doc who did a second opinion on diagnosis said I probably had been living with it for 16 years; the math fits, a bout of mono in 1981 (just before my 20th birthday) fatigue and numbness starting in my feet and legs is what got me to a doctor.\nToday I put very little faith in the docs.

    "Post" : "Hi 502E79\nI agree the article is a bit much to read and I can certainly understand vision issues trying to read all of it. The \"itis\" portion of Transverse Myelitis means inflammation of the spinal cord. This could be caused by many things including MS or NMO.\nThere are blood tests for NMO and NMO is treated differently than MS. NMO has spinal cord lesions that are elongated and cover a larger area of the spinal cord. MS spinal cord lesions are small spots much like we see on the brain MRIs.\nMy knowledge of NMO is limited, although I had testing for it quite some years ago. We have had members on MSWorld that have been diagnosed with MS when in fact it was NMO and those that were diagnosed from the start with NMO.\nGrace53 is a long time member that has been very helpful through the years on the topic of NMO. I have not seen her on MSWorld for quite some time and hope she is still hanging in there with NMO.\nTransverse Myelitis can be caused by many things, and not necessarily MS or NMO.\nSorry if this still causes a problem with your vision\nBelow is from the URL I posted.\nImmune system disorders. These disorders appear to play an important role in causing damage to the spinal cord. Such disorders are:\naquaporin-4 autoantibody associated neuromyelitis optica.\nMultiple Sclerosis.\npost-infectious or post-vaccine autoimmune phenomenon, in which the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks the body’s own tissue while responding to the infection or, less commonly, a vaccine\nan abnormal immune response to an underlying cancer that damages the nervous system; or\nother antibody-mediated conditions that are still being discovered.\nViral infections.\nIt is often difficult to know whether direct viral infection or a post-infectious response to the infection causes the transverse myelitis. Associated viruses include herpes viruses such as varicella zoster (the virus that causes chickenpox and shingles), herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr; flaviviruses such as West Nile and Zika; influenza, echovirus, hepatitis B, mumps, measles, and rubella.\nBacterial infections\nsuch as syphilis, tuberculosis, actinomyces, pertussis, tetanus, diphtheria, and Lyme disease. Bacterial skin infections, middle-ear infections, campylobacter jejuni gastroenteritis, and mycoplasma bacterial pneumonia have also been associated with the condition.\nFungal infections in the spinal cord, including Aspergillus, Blastomyces, Coccidioides, and Cryptococcus.\nParasities, including Toxoplasmosis, Cysticercosis, Shistosomiasis, and Angtiostrongyloides.\nOther inflammatory disorders that can affect the spinal cord, such as sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren’s syndrome, mixed connective tissue disease, scleroderma, and Bechet’s syndrome.\nVascular disorders such as arteriovenous malformation, dural arterial-venous fistula, intra spinal cavernous malformations, or disk embolism.",

If vegans are educated about nutrition, it can be a healthy lifestyle. I've known some vegans who aren't supplementing with B12, which is important. And other vegans who fill their diet with empty carbs (too much btead, pasta, etc). Since you're a long-term vegan, you're likely avoiding those pitfalls.\nSome of us have had some success with going off gluten and dairy.

Whew~~ I would have had to be committed! (I was in limbo for10 years and I thought that was a long time.)\nBut, now you have a neuro that has taken you seriously. Hooray! Even though no one really wants to have MS, you must relieved. I wonder what kind of treatment plan you and your Dr. are discussing? You will have to let us know. We have a forum discussing DMT's that you might want to look through and see what others are taking. https://www.msworld.org/forum/forumd...amp-Treatments\nWe also have a thread about different DMT comparisons - https://www.msworld.org/forum/showth...omparing-DMT-s\nHelp and hope is on the way! Thanks for sharing your story and a warm welcome\nKeep in touch and let us know how it's going for you!",

His eyebrows raised when I explained that I’d had problems since age 15, but he never patronized me or treated me like a nutcase. Since he didn’t have access to my old records, he said we’d just start over from the beginning to rule things out, and that maybe it’s time to look for the less-common illnesses. I’ve had 26 blood tests in one day, another MRI, an EMG, nerve conduction test, sleep study, and spinal tap. He also believes that the TIA’s were misdiagnosed and were actually MS attacks. He’s done more for me in 3 months than all the other doctors put together over the last 4 decades. I see him again in 2 weeks to discuss possible treatment options, and I finally have hope.\nThank goodness for your new neuro!\nLet us know how your appointment goes. Thank you!\nTake Care",

    "Post" : "Originally posted by greatexp View Post\nGood morning. I'm very nearly 60, have been diagnosed for 3 years with RRMS, and currently am on Copaxone 40 mg. I had a neurological \"event\" (CIS?) over 20 years ago. The neurologist at that time did an MRI and LP to rule out MS or a brain tumor, but said the results were negative. A few symptoms showed up through the years, mainly headaches and deep aching pain in my legs. I was busy with 5 kids and part time work, but did have the leg pain checked into a few times with no answers. A relapse caused me to see my PCP, who ordered an MRI, and that showed multiple lesions. LP still showed no oligoclonal bands.\nI finally talked my husband into giving up the 20 acre farm to move to town, and am so grateful to be here now in a one-story house. I'm also grateful for good family and friends, the fact that I was able to raise the kids before this struck so hard, and for my faith. I can still quilt like crazy, do a little gardening, and play piano at church most weeks, and that's wonderful. We have a homely dog, and he forces me to get out and walk most days.\nMy daughter was recently diagnosed with CMT, and though no one in my family ever mentioned being diagnosed, I have my father's \"funny\" feet. My daughter's neurologist told her \"it's the most common neurological disease that no one has ever heard of.\" I do see a few threads about others who may have both MS and CMT.\nHello greatexp\nWelcome!\nThank you for sharing your story.\nHope you continue to post, and share your experiences.\nIf you have any questions, just ask and we'll be glad to help, if we can.\nTake Care",

Thank you for being so refreshing.\nOkay, now for the nuts and bolts, so to speak. If I'm out of place just pay no attention. Medically, a couple of things in your post jumped out at me.\nFirst, it is a bit unusual to be first diagnosed with MS at 57. Certainly, not unheard of by any means, but a bit of an outlier. If you don't mind me asking... did a neurologist specializing in MS make that diagnosis?\nYour daughter has CMT, which has a hereditary component. Your father has \"funny feet\"? I'm not sure what that is. But it makes one wonder if perhaps he had an undiagnosed neurological problem such as CMT. You see where I am going, don't you?\nIt appears that CMT is hereditary, your daughter was diagnosed, your father may have had it, so is it possible you may have inherited a susceptibility to CMT? I mention it because about 20% of people diagnosed with MS have been mis-diagnosed according to epidemiologists.\nPlease forgive me if I am being intrusive. These were things I wondered as I read your lovely post and I always want to be honest... even when I am way off base!\nThanks again, I hope I didn't upset you.\nBest Wishes!",

    "Post" : "I know you all arent medical professionals, and I have had, and continue to have, plenty of appointments. But Ive also found a lot of information and perspectives here that doctors haven’t shared, and I am really taking my self advocacy very seriously. To that end, I have questions for your feedback.\nIm at a place where I think, as many people here do, that I may have been having symptoms going back over 18 years or so. Mostly bladder urgency, and then facial numbness a few years ago. Problems always resolved themselves within weeks, so I thought nothing of it.\nBut my current situation has been going on for almost 7 months now. Tremor in hands, numbness in hands and feet, memory issues, bladder urgency, tightness in my calves, twitching all over, ringing and popping in my ears, now I am having crazy night sweats and trouble sleeping, etc. Everything comes and goes, like the bladder only lasted a few weeks, but the whole suite of symptoms is sticking around and rotating throughout my body. Memory issues everyday.\nI guess my question is: are the doctors looking for a flare? I see so much written about people going totally and temporarily numb or blind and it goes away. Something big and obvious. And it seems like the doctors are looking at me and not seeing a “flare” like that and being dismissive.\nIve had a lot of tests since May. First MRI came back with “a few tiny foci” but nueros said not of a size, shape or location to cause concern. Spine MRI clear. Contrast MRI came back as “normal MRI of the Brain”, and Lumbar Puncture showed no obands in relation to my serum. These were all done at highly ranked Academic Med centers in NYC.\nAny thoughts on how to continue advocating for myself beside third and fourth opinions? Is it “just keep going”, have patience and wait? If, indeed, this has been going on for 18 years, there would be something distinct and irrefutable on my MRI, no?\nAny advice welcome.",

These were all done at highly ranked Academic Med centers in NYC.\nAny thoughts on how to continue advocating for myself beside third and fourth opinions? Is it “just keep going”, have patience and wait? If, indeed, this has been going on for 18 years, there would be something distinct and irrefutable on my MRI, no?\nAny advice welcome.\nHmmm. Are doctors looking for a flare -- good question. It's, actually, a question I wouldn't have thought to ask. At this point, I suspect, they are looking for a diagnosis. Regardless of what the diagnosis turns out to be, multiple illnesses could have flares.\nIf docs are looking for a dx, then, when they make a diagnosis, they can begin to look at strategies to treat the illness (DMD -- disease-modifying meds). But, if they're just looking for a dx and not a flare, then they may not be considering how to treat your symptoms.\nHowever, if they identify what you have as a likely flare, in whatever illness it may be, they could treat the symptoms of the flare. Even before they have diagnosed an illness. is that why you're asking? If it's a flare, it could be treated with steroids. Even if it's not a flare, the symptoms might benefit from treatment with other meds.\nThe thoughts that your questions triggered in me take me back to my pre-diagnosis stage. My neuro was looking for a dx, and while considering MS as a possibility, was ruling out all kinds of other illnesses. But, he was focusing on finding a dx. And, my symptoms continued to become worse and worse. It was actually my husband's personal care physician, who was also a personal friend of the family, that prescribed steroids to help to manage the symptoms, because I was so very ill and still in limbo. He seemed to be quicker to realize that my symptoms needed to be acknowledged and managed, even while the process of being diagnosed was still underway.\nIs that the direction you're going with your question? That, if you are in a flare, regardless of the dx, the flare needs to be acknowledged and treated? Or, even if your symptoms aren't triggered by a flare, they still could benefit from treatment?\nOr, am I reading things in between the lines that aren't there? Are you asking for different reasons?",

    "Post" : "Most flares don't last that long, even without steroids. I seem to be an exception to that.\nPrior to diagnosis, my second flare went on and on and got worse untily husband's PCP rx'd steroids. After that, I always had steroids until two other times. I won't go into detail, but they were also not resolved, and got worse, until steroids were started. Maybe not seven months, but sometimes 3-5 months.\nSo, yeah. In your situation, I don't know if it's still a flare that would benefit from steroids.\nBut that's a question you could ask. You could also ask about meds for symptom management.\nIn the meantime, take care of yourself.\n- Get enough sleep.\n- Prevent stress when possible. Learn how to manage it when it's not preventable.\n- Consider yoga, mindfulness, meditation, a cup of tea, a soothing bath, listening to relaxing music, deep breathing, identifying your \"happy place\" and going there in your mind, etc.\n- Eat a healthy diet. Lots of greens and other fruits and vegetables (consider 9 total per day), grass fed meats / free range poultry (sparingly), as much wild- caught fish as you want,. Consider wheat free, dairy free, no can sugar or artificial sweeteners (honey and 100% maple syrup ok; stevia ok).\n- Exercise moderately.\n- Get rid of toxins in your environment.",

I moved it over to our Tell Us About Yourself forum from here: (https://www.msworld.org/forum/showth...post1425690)so it might be more likely to be noticed by others.\nI wish that I had some helpful advice for you. When I read your post, and the post that you responded to, it reminded me of symptoms that I used to experience about 10 years ago. For me, my MS flares were atypical in that, when I was in a flare, I experienced manic symptoms and sometimes psychosis and other things. I turned into \"someone I'm not\".\nMy MS doctors didn't know how to treat my mental health symptoms. The mental health specialists (psychiatrists, etc) didn't know how to treat the MS. I experienced flares of this magnitude once or twice a year for about 7 years, ending up as an inpatient in a mental health facility for 1-3 weeks each time. The treatment that eventually worked, each time, for me, was to treat it as an MS flare, with high doses of steroids.\nEventually, I switched from a general neurologist to an MS Specialist. She changed my MS med to one that was more effective for me in 2008, and I've not been hospitalized or had an MS flare in years.\nI'm not sure any of that will be helpful in your mother's situation.

The doctor did some basic reflect / strength testing. He tested reflexes in my knees, which seem to respond to his touches. While sitting, he had me lift my legs up and he tried pushing down on them and was able to. I was able to follow movements with the pen with my eyes and he did not note any issues with that. He did observe my hand tremoring/shaking that is still occuring daily.\nIn addition to all the above, I am also having occasional sharp pains down in the urinary tract area. At random times I will get a quick sharp pain. It definitely takes you for a surprise.\nThank you so much everyone for your feedback. I realize that every MS case seems to be unique in it's development and type of symptoms, however is there any thought as to whether the symptoms I described above can be considered (somewhat) typical of someone who is in the early stage of possible MS? Do patients usually only see 1 symptom at a time, or are multiple symptoms as I described above \"normal\" to see in the early phase? Does this in any way indicate that I may have more of a progressive form of MS, as opposed to relapsing-recurring type?\nI am trying to get in to see a MS Neurologist, but they seem to book out appointments a couple of months, which is disappointing. For now I will just go with the MRI that the general Neurologist recommends, I just figured it would be worth asking for a specific type if that was the general consensus.\nI have times where I get so mad at myself for having the cut to my finger, as I really believe that was the trigger for all this, but I am trying not to be so hard on myself and just move forward.\nI do take a multi-vitamin every day, but if there are any other supplements or types of food that are recommended, I would love to hear what those are. I really hope research will continue to get patients closer to a cure. Thanks again everyone!",

I don't know what the typical path is, in terms of what type of Provider I should see. I also did get back the results from the Western Blot Lyme test and they were negative, along with the other two (ELISA) tests I previously had done.\nWhen you say 'Provider', are you talking about your neurologist, as the one who wants you to see a Neuro-Muscular Specialist?\nOriginally posted by kdrymer View Post\nWith this being still very early, is it possible the brain may not display/have any lesions yet formed? Could there be lesions only on the spinal cord, and not on the brain, that would be indicative of MS?\nMy non-professional answer is yes, it's possible - to both questions.\nDo you have a follow-up appointment scheduled with your neuro?

I'm glad that the brain MRI showed as normal, with no signs of optic neuritis, but I've heard that in the early stages of MS that lesion activity may not show up on an MRI, but I don't know how accurate this is. I think I am going to try to make an appointment with the Neuro-Muscular specialist at this point and see what he/she's reccomendation is. I also am still considering seeing the Lyme specialist who uses a private lab in CA (Igenix) that supposedly has more accurate testing protocols than the CDC methods.",

I have had facial tics here and there, but so many different things can cause those, including stress. My main symptoms early-on were visual.\nYou might not encounter another person with MS who can bolster a diagnosis based on symptoms. It's that shady! But these things are good to note, to tell your doctor about.\nAnd thanks for your last response - glad you already ruled that out.\nIf possible, try to do things to distract yourself from too many thoughts about what might be a symptom.

    "Post" : "Hello all - just wanted to provide an update. I had an appointment yesterday with a Neuromuscular specialist. He did an extensive physical examination and then performed both an EMG and Nerve Conduction study. At the end he concluded that he strongly believes I do not have a neuromuscular disorder, or show any signs of muscle atrophy.\nWhile this is good news in the sense that is likely not a muscle degenerative disorder, it brings me back to square one. I asked about the likelihood of this being MS and he felt it was not based on the clear brain MRI but said I could see a MS specialist if I wanted to. He seemed to suggest that my symptoms are more psychological and that I should take a break from seeing specialists for a couple months.\nI have an appointment tomorrow with my Primary Care Provider to re-group and go over what I have had done, as I have not had an appointment with him in a couple of months. I am considering asking him about both having an MRI of the spinal cord, as well as a referral to a MS specialist.\nI'm looking for feedback as to whether it would make sense to request a spinal cord MRI first and then depending on the results, then have a referral to a MS specialist if something suspicious was seen. The other option is to hold off on the spinal MRI and just be referred to the MS specialist to see what their recommendations are. Of course I would need to get my PCP to agree to one of these options.\nI continue to have the same symptoms. I have the intermittent left shoulder pain, along with the muscle spasms/twitching in the calves (legs), upper arms, and left eye-brow area. I also have what feels like tears behind the outside corner of my eyes (only 1 eye at a time does it occur though).\nAnyways, what are your thoughts? Perhaps I should be looking at seeing a Rheumotologist or Immunologist? Thanks in advance.",

    "Post" : "Kevin,\nIf you see an MS specialist, they will look at all the tests done to date. They may only order a spinal MRI if you show clinical abnormalities. It is possible they would order even with normal exam, but be prepared they may not. If you do get a spinal MRI from your PCP and it is clear, it may be difficult to get an appointment with an MS specialist. They often ask who is referring you, what tests you have and results - at least that was my experience.\nAre you dismissing that the variety of symptoms may have a psychological and or anxiety component to them? Personally, if I was told that I didn't have MS and my symptoms were psychological, as frustrating as it is, I would be celebrating. Yes, there are stories of people having been told that, only to find out years later it is MS. But I think this is getting rarer as MRI technology gets better and MS knowledge has improved. While not every lesion will show on an MRI, and some may even disappear, there is usually a clinical abnormality. Some docs may do a spinal tap in that scenario.",

I stay with the VA because some drugs are very very expensive as MS patients are very well aware of and co pays can run hundred or even thousands a month and are free through the VA. Full disclosure, I do not have MS. My wife does.\nTia, To begin, could you tell me what state you reside in? Some states have more liberal rules regarding supplements then others.",

Never any terrible problems just little things here and there.\nActually, this doesn't sound \"stupid\" at all to me. As someone who was in limbo for quite awhile, I was relieved to receive an MS dx, because then I knew what was wrong and could begin treatment. It makes sense to me that you would wish for a quick dx without a long period of continued uncertainty.\nI hope you find some definitive answers soon.",

    "Post" : "Originally posted by billyreuben View Post\nHi, my name is Bill and I have finally decided to come out of my shell from when I was first diagnosed with RRMS in 2011. I have kept things a complete secret because of the fear of the stigma associated with the diagnosis. I had a very competitive job, and my coworkers would have eaten me alive if they knew.\nMS wasn't new to me, however. I am a physical therapist and I used to work on an MS unit at a rehab hospital for a number of years and then in their homes. When I received my diagnosis I had the advantage of knowing a lot and also the disadvantage of knowing a lot. I developed a game with my neurologist to see if I could guess which part of the brain had the lesion before we looked at the MRI.\nRecently my job came to an end. I decided to just tell everyone. I am not sure what people think of this but I am going to open my own therapy practice with a focus on patients with MS. I wonder what people on here would think of receiving care from a provider with MS?\nMy greatest fear is not being available to my two daughters and wife as this disease progresses. To try to manage that stress I started a blog about random advice I am writing for my young daughters now for them to review later as adults. I want them to know their dad before the disease progresses (with a high degree of optimism that the medications we have now will slow this disease down to a crawl). Note that some of the topics are random and ridiculous- just like their dad.\nThanks for reading and nice to meet everyone.\nBill\nWelcome to are exclusive club and let me say that is awesome but my concern would be insurance for you and your family because of with MS it really hard to get treatment for it.

    "Post" : "Yep!!!! Great life!!!\nLove it too.\nWe have had a bad drought in aus and we lost some animals because of it. its heart breaking to have to shoot cattle or have them die because they get so weak from lack of food.\nIt cost a lot for hay last year and it still wasn't enough ,so we are in the process of putting in our own patch of irrigation so it doesn't happen again.\nI went through the effort last week to get all our cattle in and drafted off the calves for weaning. This took most of the day and even though i was tired etc it was a good day.\nThe trouble is that when i returned to our yards to check on the water trough there was a cow in with the calves. She had jumped the rails in a panel where the to rail had been busted by a falling tree, even though it was still 3 rails high, to get at the calves hay and she wasn't happy about me putting her back out. They can be so human some times\nI hope the horses had a belly ache the other day too. The greedy things had eaten 2 slabs of lucern each while i wormed and pampered them, but unfortunately my husband left the shipping container door ajar where we store it and they helped themselves to the rest.\nSo they won't be getting any treats for a while.\nEven though it can be tough and hard work i strongly believe that keeping going both physically and mentally has helped me maintain many functions that i may have lost. If i didn't have kids and animals that depend on me to get physical i would be so unfit.\nAnd it makes me feel alive!!\nThe 'experts' are telling us now that one of the best things for our heath and well being is interacting with nature.\nThis has always been true imho.\nThanks for sharing.\nCaroline",

My eye dr was the first to identify that something was wrong which set me down the path of my MS diagnosis.\nWhile you are waiting for the eye dr appointment, I would at least try to see if there are any neurologists that they recommend.\nI've met a number of neurologists and I would say that finding one with a really good bedside manner is difficult. But with some of my drs, I'll take their expertise and level of tenacity to find out what's wrong over a cheerful demeanor. This is probably why ratings are low--that and the fact that sometimes neuros don't tell us what we want to hear or vice versa, so they'll get lower ratings for that. I would take the ratings with a grain of salt unless there are a number of people complaining about the same thing--and depends on what that thing is too.\nAs for the PCP--if you are happy with their care otherwise, I'd say keep them, but if you feel like you are consistently being ignored or brushed off in all areas of your care--I would start looking for a new one.\nGood luck!",

There are some of us who were diagnosed at an earlier age that have been able to take symptoms back before the age of 18, have you? There were 2 MRI machines in the entire State of Colorado at that time I was going through the diagnostic process.\nPlus, all those symptoms had \"logical\" explanations and could be easily excused and written off.\nHow easy it is to ignore odd symptoms and even thinking it could simply be normal I definitely did it.\nMy attitude was that I needed to cope with this disease mainly on my own.\nYes. No treatments except steroids and possibly symptom management medication, if wanted or needed. Did you have a lottery number for Betaseron?\nAnd since you cannot do much about them, you might as well put a happy spin on them, right? Whether you laugh with sarcasm or dark humor, or whether you cry -- that is a choice. And to me laughing is a helluva lot more fun than crying.\nI agree.

But every time I stop eating gluten and cut it out of my diet, in about 7 to 10 days my mental clarity will undergo radical changes for the better.\nIt's like before I was in a drunken, hang-over phase, and after stopping gluten I'm sharp as a tack and it's like someone added 10 or 15 IQ points -- an improvement so dramatic that I happily avoid gluten (which is a PITA since gluten's in everything it seems).",

I began seeing all kinds of specialists and found out so much. My back was destroyed and surgery was not an option. I also found out that my heart was messed up.\nThen I get told that I have fibromyalgia.\nBut now I am losing the ability to use my legs. I am falling more often. I have drop foot, and so many other symptoms of ms. My primary said how could we have missed it. She immediately prescribed a walker and referred me to a new neurologist.\nHe is scheduling EMG (Upper and lower) before I get the spinal tap. My insurance company is giving us the run around.\nAlso when I told my best friend about this diagnosis, she actually googled it and was putting me through the 20 questions.. Who would lie about this ?\nI feel like everyone is calling me a liar. Why would I lie?\nHi wsr1966\nWelcome to our message boards.\nI'm sorry to learn that you have been going through so many health issues for the past five years - chronic pain, back problems, heart issues, fibromyalgia, and now possibly MS.\nI don't know why your best friend and others seem to doubt your health issues.\nThey should be thanking their lucky stars that they don't have to deal with these problems.\nIt has to be very difficult to deal with all of this, and then to not have good support from others.\nHopefully your insurance company issues get straightened out soon.\nGood luck with your upcoming tests, and your neuro appointment.\nPlease let us know what you find out.\nFeel free to come here and share how you are doing, ask questions, and vent if you need to!\nTake Care",

Losing your ability to walk, falling and foot drop can all be due to back problems. Have you discussed your back problems with a Neurosurgeon? I'm not sure why surgery is not an option, if your symptoms are due to your back it can get worse\nHope you find some relief for your symptoms.",

You were treated for a flare/relapse in September.\nI have PPMS and don't have first hand experience with what you are experiencing. So hopefully other members with RRMS will chime in.\nThe only other thing that I'm thinking of is that sometimes an infection, such as a UTI, or a virus, can cause an increase in symptoms (called a pseudo-exacerbation or pseudo-relapse).\nAny chance of that?\nTake Care",

Also, for me, if I am less active and find myself laying around more when sick, I can sometimes get dizzy.\nAs Koko pointed out, infections can sometimes cause pseudo flares. These pseudo flares can also be triggered when overheated. For me, if overly fatigued and I don't listen to my body, I also get a pseudo flare.\nFinally, MS iteslf can cause dizziness, but so can other medical issues. If it persists, you may want to see an Ear, Nose, Throat specialist to see if any cause can be found and treated. My neuro prescribed vestibular therapy, a specialized form of PT. Some people benefit from it.\nHope you feel better soon.",

    "Post" : "Welcome.\nIt is really hard to get a feel when depression and anxiety cloud our thinking. MS itself can cause it, but also being fairly newly diagnosed, it can cause a situational type of depression and anxiety. I do hope whatever the cause, you can get this treated effectively. Side effects from untreated depression and anxiety can also contribute to MS like symptoms.\nBefore your neuro changes a diagnosis, make sure you discuss the impact it could have on medications. I believe as long as still in the relapsing definition, they would be open to you, but that is me guessing. Especially if you are considering going on meds later after pregnancy. You don't want the option taken away.\nBest of luck.",

Are you taking anything to treat your symptoms? Medications for these are things you CAN control when everything else seems out of control.\nI wish you well\nHonestly all I can do is do therapy.. I have PTSD and GAD outside of my MS and mood stabilizers and other depression medication cause me to be quite suicidal.. I've been off and on every well known and a few not well known depression meds when they had misdiagnosed my anxiety when I was younger and they discovered medication is not a good route as far as controlling the depression.\nWe Still haven't really figured out if its medical depression or if it's just the trauma of when and how I got my MS diagnosis on top of my already difficult life that's causing me to be depressed because who wouldn't be in my position. I went to therapy for adjustment disorder and that was pretty helpful and I'm currently on a break as I'm also currently dealing with a very big move soon.\nI am on Adderal to help with my hypersomnia and i'm on prazosin to help control my PTSD induced nightmares, And I take multivitamins to help keep my vitamin D levels up because I have a vitamin D deficiency. I need to figure out an affordable diet to maybe help with weight control and energy levels. My husband is a nurse and we are all very well versed on my plan of care. I'm currently just trying to find a balance with everything.",

    "Post" : "Hello Alto Tabo!\nHang in there! You are 29 and knowledge is rapidly expanding so it is likely that tremendous strides will be taken in the treatment of MS and MS symptoms during your lifetime which will benefit you greatly.\nFor now, please don't do anything which might disqualify you for an approved DMT should you change your mind and desire to try one. Some insurance companies will not pay for some very expensive DMTs if your diagnosis is PPMS rather than RRMS.\nRight now, Ocrevus is the only DMT approved for PPMS. Any insurance company paying $76,000 a year (last year's average cost of an MS DMT) for something not even approved for the condition or disease could legally stop at any time.\nOf course, they would have to pay for symptom management, however, not for a DMT unless it was Ocrevus, the only approved DMT for PPMS.\nAll I am saying is don't let your neuro make a decision which can limit your options. Your husband will help you if this isn't making sense but you are bright and on top of things so I believe you get my point.\nI believe in you! There is hope, health, and happiness ahead for you. Do what you can within your limits to improve your life... diet, attitude, friendships, family life. Take small steps but meaningful ones. Your loved ones need you! You are absolutely the right person for them! Fulfill your purpose in their lives! I trust you will because you are amazing, you really are!\nBest to you!!!!!",

There are better days ahead!\nThe solumedrol will likely help a great deal, especially with your vision issues. I saw you had a bunch of great responses to your solumedrol post!\nI wanted to comment on your neuro's choice of DMT's and say that I agree 100% with choosing Tysabri. My spouse began taking natalizumab (Tysabri) in 2002 and was virtually MS free until 2017 when she switched from Tysabri to Ocrevus due to her concerns about PML.\nOcrevus is a very good medicine. Tysabri is a great medicine. Both are substantially more effective in trials and real world experience than the 3 orals or any of the early MS meds (CRAB). You can learn a great deal about all of the MS DMTs at this site, and I am sure you are educating yourself about Tysabri since your doctor mentioned it.\nI believe your neuro has you headed in the right direction.\nBest of luck to you!",

And, in the past, when the group \"died\" for awhile, because of lack of use, my exercising went down considerably. Since we've resurrected it, our base has been fairly stable. I'm always glad to see everyone check in each week.\nOthers are always welcome to join our Exercise Check-In, posted weekly in The Wellness Forum. You set your own goals. You can keep the same goals week-to-week, or modify them. You decide if you accomplished them. Check in once a week to let us know how you did last week, and to set goals for the following week.",

    "Post" : "Myoak\nHi again,\nAm just adding a post to this thread so as not to hijack a post in sym & treatments.\nThanks for asking after me Myoak. Am doing ok thanks and have looked into LDN in the past and would like to try it, but from memory.... don't think it was available in Aus at the time. May be now.\nAlso thought i\"d share something-\nI have been on paroxetine for a while now and it does seem to have improved mood fluctuations etc and will continue.\nBut i took my last pill in pack the day before yesterday and then forgot to get more so skipped yesterdays dose.\nIt says everywhere \"do not stop taking this drug abruptly\". I have run out before and it's taken a couple of days for the effects to be noticeable. It seems to effect my sleep and dreams and activity while asleep especially- weird dreams and talking that get worse and become nightmares and yelling (so my husband says).\nI didn't think missing the one dose yesterday would be too bad and intend to get more today.\nNow i am not especially afraid of snakes but last night i dreamt that i had fallen and had a dead one across my chest and my husband had startled another and it was coming straight at my face, so i grabbed the one across my chest to whack the one coming at me away with.... now the pain and astonishment!!!! I woke up having actually tried to do this in my sleep, and had succeeded in throwing myself out of bed doing a 360 and and landing a metre from my bed and up against the wall in the middle of the night! I'm not sure whether to be proud of myself and proclaim my acrobatic accomplishments to the world and bare the bruises like battle scars or be embarrassed?\nI do know one thing though - I ain't missin takin any of dem dare pills agin!!!\nAny hoooo i hope my little nocturnal adventure gives you guys a giggle.\nCaroline.",

    "Post" : "Hello Carol,\nThere seem to be many MSers taking B12 for fatigue and I believe it helps. It isn't a complete answer but if we can do a lot of small things which are beneficial then maybe we can achieve something significant in fighting fatigue. As you said, Vitamin D is awfully important, too. I can't imagine anyone with MS not knowing what their Vit D level is. I see you are on Tysabri. How is that going? May I ask how often you get infusions? Are you JCV+?\nBest!\nHi Caroline,\nYep, pretty odd that a med to help with fatigue often makes you more fatigued when starting. Welcome to the world of MS meds! We all hope better things come along soon and of course, there are numerous studies always taking place so we do expect better treatments for fatigue to become available.\nI wanted to ask the same question of you, Caroline... how often do you get infusions of Tysabri? I'm a little embarrassed to ask the next question because I should have remembered but I'm too lazy to go back and look through your posts... are you JCV+?\nAs you know, I am really beginning to question the wisdom of my spouse switching from Tysabri to Ocrevus as expressed in other threads.\nBe well!

    "Post" : "Originally posted by riverlady5783 View Post\nI've had MS for many years (diagnosed in 1983). There have been many up and downs, but this last bad relapse has overwhelmed me. A month ago my husband had a second heart attack. We live in northern British Columbia and he was sent by air ambulance to a bigger center. He had 5 stents put in and was sent home. He absolutely refused to have me come with him, and our daughter was with him. The stress of sitting by the phone waiting for a call was so difficult. I thought I was going to lose him. Then two days after Ken came home, our beloved little dog had multiple seizures and died in my arms. (There is no vet available here on weekends.) Then there were some extended family stresses I could do nothing about. No surprise - a week ago I had a big relapse that hit my legs and vision.\nI had 3 days of IV Solumedrol that were difficult (anxiety and panic attacks). Now I'm left with painful muscle spasms in my legs and I feel overwhelmed and hopeless. I tried to talk to my family doctor and was given a prescription for antidepressants. She has never been very supportive and appointments are always rushed. I'm trying to be strong for my husband, but am not sleeping and my legs are hurting. This is so difficult and I don't have anyone to talk to.\nThank you for listening. Someone please tell me that things will get better.\nLisa\nHi Lisa\nI can't even imagine going through the heartaches and stresses that you have endured during the past month. I feel for you, and am sending healing thoughts your way.\nIt seems that for now, you need to take care of yourself, especially getting good sleep. Lack of sleep for those of us with MS can wreak havoc with our physical, mental, and emotional well being.\nLife is a little more tolerable, and doesn't look quite as bad, when we are well rested.\nDid your doctor prescribe anything for your painful leg spasms? I wonder if treating your spasms would then help you to sleep better?\nI do think that things will get better for you. Try to make it a priority to take good care of yourself, ok? Don't be afraid to call your doctor if you need something for the painful spasms.\nAlso, feel free to vent as much as you need to! We'll be here to listen.\nWishing both you and your husband quick recoveries, and hope you feel better each day.\nTake Care",

Your many situations, experiences and losses, coupled with living in a somewhat isolated location, in terms of medical services, provides you with many challenges.\nI don't really have any additional advice, other than trying to take care of yourself while you recover from your flare, and trying to reduce stress.\nFor me, I have personally found that managing stress, after it occurs, is difficult. Instead, I have tried, as much as possible (and it isn't always possible), to prevent stress. I use techniques such as saying \"no\" to others when I need to, advocating for my own needs, getting plenty of rest, adding in some pamper-time (whatever restores your spirit -- it's different for us all), finding one or more supportive friends or family members, asking for help when I need it, etc.\nIf your husband also needs care, at this point, it sounds like you are unable to provide it. Find someone who can. A friend, a family member, people from your church, a neighbor, etc. Maybe you can make your requests specific, and spread out your requests among many, so as not to over-burden any one person.",

    "Post" : "Diet quality is associated with mobility and cognitive function in people with multiple sclerosis\nBackground: People with multiple sclerosis (MS) are at increased risk of metabolic disorders like diabetes and hyperlipidemia. Aspects of diet are important determinants of metabolic comorbidities in the general population and influence mechanisms relevant to MS (immune/mitochondrial function, oxidative stress and action of gut microbiota). However, evidence linking diet with objective MS outcomes is sparse.\nObjective: To assess the association between diet quality and disability and neurological function in people with MS.\nMethods: We conducted an observational study of people with MS who completed MS Performance Test-based (MSPT) assessment of neurologic function and a 153-item food frequency questionnaire. For each individual, we calculated the Healthy Eating Index-2010, which is a composite measure of dietary quality favorably weighting an individual's intake of fruits, vegetables, legumes, seafood/plant proteins, whole grains, mono/polyunsaturated fat, other proteins and unfavorably weighting intakes of sodium, added-sugars and refined grains. Scores ranged from 0 (poorest quality) to 100 (optimal quality). We evaluated the association between diet scores and MS outcomes including disability (Patient Determined Disease Steps [PDDS]) and objective neurological outcomes (walking speed, manual dexterity and processing speed) using generalized linear models, as appropriate and adjusting for age, sex, disease subtype and duration, years of education and body mass index (BMI).\nResults: We analyzed data from 277 participants (78% female, mean age: 48.2y [standard deviation; SD: 12.7y], mean BMI: 28.2 [SD: 7.5]) who completed MSPT and diet assessments. Participants in the highest quartile of dietary quality had significantly higher processing speeds, faster 25-foot walking speeds and marginally faster manual dexterity speeds relative to individuals in the lowest quartile... Individuals in the highest quartile were also at a significantly lower risk of moderate vs. mild disability.\nConclusions: High dietary quality was associated with lesser disease severity using measures of disability, mobility and cognitive function. Longitudinal studies should evaluate if high quality diets predict slower rates of disability accrual.",

The only one that definitely didn't work for me was Betaseron. I built up antibodies to Betaseron so that one was no longer effective and led to my last relapse.\nTysabri was fine for me, but I was on it a year and my neuro tested me and I was JCV+, plus I wanted to have another baby.\nSo I switched to Copaxone.

I know I don’t know you but none the less am very proud of you \uD83D\uDE0A\nOriginally posted by lorib View Post\nOn Sept. 29, 2004, my GP told me my MRI results were ‘indicative’ of MS. I was 23 and essentially said, \"What the hell is MS? Is it fatal? And WHY me?!\" It was a really, really terrible day.\nI had been out of college a year, making plans to go to grad school, and planning for my future. I can’t even explain how scared I was as I'm sure many people here understand! I figured I had two choices, move on with my life or sit and feel sorry for myself. I moved on and did my best.\nI have been incredibly fortunate that in 10 years I have gotten married, had two wonderful children, started and completed my PhD, and moved out of state…twice, and I’m in the best shape I have ever been!\nDon't get me wrong; every morning is a struggle to make it a good day. Some days I fail miserably but most days I succeed. What choice do I have? I refuse to settle for a life that is mediocre!\nOver these past 10 years I've been through a lot of crappy stuff as I'm sure everyone can identify with. I've been hospitalized; I've been poked for an IV so many times I stopped counting (I mean how many veins do we have to blow before we let someone else try!); I've experienced a lot of the side effects from the 4 different MS meds I've been on and who doesn't love the steroids and the associated insomnia! I also realize that there are worse things that I haven't experienced. I'm not sure if or when it will be my turn, but I won't let it ruin today.\nDespite all of this, I've come a long way in 10 years. I am so very thankful that my MS does well with the dmds and that I've always had insurance. Back in 2004 I was afraid of what my life would be like in 2014. I don't know what the next 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years have in store for me, but I'll just continue to take it a day at a time and do my best because that's all I can do!",

How was his Neurological exam?\nmy son complained about his eyes but the doctor didn't seem to think it was a big deal. Said he had astigmatism.\nDid he see an Ophthalmologist? Astigmatism can be helped with corrective lenses. MS doesn't cause dry eyes. Dry eyes can be caused by looking at a monitor/computer, TV, Phones, etc. for too long. Being tired can cause dry eyes. MS does not cause Astigmatism.\nI am a little confused why you believe your son has MS. Your son has seen Drs. and has been given explanations for his complaints, but you think it's MS?. A CT Scan is not part of the diagnostic criteria for MS. Was it a Neurologist that has ordered the MRI?\nAs for the guilt and worry you are experiencing; sometimes I think this is just part of being a parent regardless of a child's age. You do need to be kind to yourself and understand at 29 years old he needs to take responsibility for his life. Be there if he needs you, but let him stand on his own. Our responsibility is to raise our children to become independent adults.\nTake care",

I was used to being to mentally overcome my fatigue so I could work even if afterwords I was out of commission.\nI can relate to this. I was able to work for 5 more years (after being diagnosed with PPMS) for the US Postal Service (processing and distribution center). I felt as if I could mentally control the physical demands, and for awhile I did. But gradually the motor fatigue became stronger than any effort I could muster to overcome it.\nI remember getting to the point of working 8 hours (even after getting a light duty position) and then being totally exhausted for the rest of the time. Eventually there was no option left but to retire on disability.\nOriginally posted by villagegirl107;1512296[/QUOTE\nSometimes now I find it difficult to accept that resting when my body tells me to and to not put expectations on myself daily to really do anything. Instead I'm trying to just do what ever small project I want to use my meager strength on that I will enjoy, just not what I feel I need to do for my family to feel worthy or whatever.\nResting when needed is very important, as well as moving our bodies to the best of our ability - safely and without getting exhausted or hurting ourselves. I have found that 30 min at a time, up and active (with rollator), is pretty much my limit before I need a rest. Doing mild stretches really helps, and walking for 30 minutes (with my rollator) 5X a week (inside my apartment) has been beneficial too.\nOriginally posted by villagegirl107;1512296[/QUOTE\nI am hoping when I am approved for disability, I will be able to really accept my new reality and focus of fighting the disease and not my own self doubt and fears of wortiness.I am hoping that by reaching out to others and connecting with people who really have been where I am I can avoid becoming a recluse hopefully keep my chin up!\nWe're glad that you have reached out to us here at MSWorld, and hope you continue to post, letting us know how you are doing.\nIf you have any questions, just ask and we'll be glad to help if we can.\nTake Care",

    "Post" : "Are you on a DMD (disease-modifying drug)? That can help reduce the frequency of flares, reduce the severity of flares, and delay progression.\nMy MS Specialist tells me that exercise is a really good way to delay progression of the disease. She especially recommends cardio for delaying progress, but says it is also good to maintain strength.\nSome people have had good success in not progressing by going on one of the MS diets. There are various diets -- and they are not all somewhat different from each other. You can learn more about them by googling.\nMatt Embry promotes one; he has a video out on Amazon.\nTerry Wahls promotes a diet that she claims helps her. She has a YouTube channel.\nOther diets include: McDougalls, Swank Diet, Jelinek, etc.\nMy functional medicine doctor recommends no wheat, no dairy, no added sugar (honey, 100% real maple syrup, fruits, etc are OK). Avoid cane sugars.\nSome people take supplements, and / or use essential oils.\nMy functional medicine doctor also recommends reducing toxins in my household.\nI wish I'd known some of these strategies and explored them earlier in my illness. Traditional MS doctors don't always believe that some of these strategies make a difference. But, I have tended, over the last few years, to gravitate to a combination of traditional medicine and CAM's (complementary and alternative medicine).\nA positive outlook in life can also contribute, in a huge way, to your continued health. Stress and anxiety are well-known to trogger strokes and heart attacks, but they also play a big role in all kinds of other health issues, including MS. Implement such stress-reducing and stress-management techniques in your life, such as meditation, prayer (even if you aren't religious, the Serenity Prayer, to a higher power), listening to music, spending quality time with family, nurturing relationships with \"right tribe\" friends (friends who share your values and interests), saying \"no\" to others when their requests would add too much stress or busy-ness in your life, etc.",

Or is it the fear of an unknown future with MS that makes you worry that you may not be able to do it one day? That one day could be tomorrow, but it could be 20 years from now, or never.\nWe all have been there, with fear. And things happen that make the fear come back. But you can't live your life in a perpetual state of fear forever. I mentioned in another thread that you really should talk to a therapist to help you get thru your diagnosis and give you some tools to help you adjust.\nFrom your other post, you mentioned you were on Copaxone, but haven't looked at efficacy. Has the Copaxone been working, have you had another relapse?\nThere are drugs that are more effective, but you have to move past your denial and fear to research. Another reason I think a therapist would help. You may still decide Copaxone is right for you, but you need to make an informed decision. I was worried in your other post where you said you couldn't look at the comparisons.\nWith MS, you need to be as proactive as you can. It is a tough balance to stay educated without overwhelming ourselves. It is lots harder when newly diagnosed. We all remember the fear and anxiety. Do something for yourself and find a way to help move you thru the stages of grief and help you accept and adjust to life with MS. It is ever evolving.",

I do not have any residual symptoms besides extreme depression and anxiety, but I know I would never forgive myself if I had a patient die while under my care because of this curse.\nThe Copaxane has worked for me and have not had any relapses. Posting on these boards is the most I have talked about/thought about this curse since I was diagnosed. I usually spend at least 10 minutes crying after I call in a refill of my medication or have to use it. I really want to just NOT think about it.\nMy problem with other medications is the side effects. Some say hair loss is a major side effect and I can’t have something like that.

I can feel you there. I'm shamed by my own cog fog... I used to be able to config a webserver at 40 paces on a rainy day. Just now, my buddy did it for me. Not totally, just let me pause for a day to let my brain catch back up to me. He wasn't down on me or anything, and was really cool and understanding about it. He's a good friend and has been for decades now.\nAnd... you can be like that to yourself. I'm taking the rest of the night off and going back to ssl configuration options tomorrow. I'll deal with it then.\n'Course, you might not have cog fog or anything like that. If you don't, count yourself lucky. If you can still walk without a wheelchair or a cane, count yourself lucky. Things can always get worse. In your case, hang on to what good you can find, and don't stress the small stuff if you don't have it anymore. You are lucky in the long run.\nBecause really, you (and we) might be \"cursed\" now, but it's easier to deal with if you just rack it up to bad luck and roll on with it.\nAnyway, sorry. It can be rough, but keep your chin up and all those \"cheesy\" bits of wisdom you don't want to think about right now.

My father is a physician ( although not a neurologist) so naturally I called him. I will never forget what he said. \"Aren't you a little old for that?\" It just goes to show you that even doctors can lack knowledge about a subject.\nI have read other posts on this Message Board about people that were diagnosed with MS even later than you are right now. You can search for them and read them. You do not mention what type of doctors you have seen or what types of testing has been done. McDonald Criteria met? Brain MRI? Lumbar puncture?

MS.\nIt is impossible to determine if your symptoms are related to Multiple Sclerosis. Many conditions have similar symptoms as those seen in MS. There is no symptom exclusive to this disease.\nYour weight and age has nothing to do with receiving testing for MS or being able to receive a diagnosis.

Others have told me after the fact, that their doctors told them not to get the inoculation! I was really pissed. I got it really bad. I was working part-time as a volunteer on a front desk. Of course, my boss had me take leave and to come back afterwards with a doctor's note saying that I was okay.

I have one lesion on my brain, 9 o-bands, and my consistent symptoms I’m still experiencing are headaches, numbness on the right side of my head and face, ringing/buzzing in my right ear, dizziness, fatigue.\nSecondary symptoms include nausea, insomnia, cog fog, depression, and mode swings. I say secondary because my Nero does not believe they are related to the lesion. He also does not believe the headache is related, but I disagree with him.\nI am 3 1/2 months into my first flare with no new symptoms so I have not been dx yet. My Nero says if I have a second attack then I will be dx and put into a treatment plan. Until then I am in limbo. I realize it could be months or even years if I have another attack, but I just hate being in this weird place where I want answers, but don’t like the idea of being dx’ed with a life long disease.

It was in the hot summer.\nI was dx with PPMS (Primary Progressive MS) 20 years ago. My early symptoms involved gait disturbances (leg weakness and dragging leg, limp), arm weakness and hand dexterity problems, bladder issues, heat sensitivity (physical weakness when too warm), eye muscle coordination problems, and Lhermitte's sign.\nThere has been a gradual, consistent progression over the years, with some plateau periods where things seem stable for awhile.\nI didn't have to wait very long for a dx because of brain and spinal cord lesions, O-Bands, and the history of progression. It must be frustrating to have to wait and wonder what is wrong while having symptoms to deal with.\nIt's good that you have faith that you can bounce back. Try to remain hopeful.\nYour symptoms may resolve over time. If you are dx'd with RRMS, there are disease modifying drugs that may prevent and slow down the relapses.\nFor now, take good care of yourself the best you can, physically, mentally, and emotionally.\nTake Care",

It's rough not knowing what's in store as the disease takes its course.\nCan I suggest that you look for MS support groups in your area? I've found that it really helps to be able to sit and talk with people who understand what you're going through. If you look at the National MS Society website, they should be able to help you find your local page with events and support groups.\nAgain, welcome, we are here for you!",

I am a newer member here but it has DEFINITELY helped me to read what others post and to chime in on a few threads too!\nI know what you mean about Cleveland Clinic-- I travel about 7 hours to visit a doc there. I was DX the last couple of months and have gone back twice since DX to get the first two (half) doses of Ocrevus. The level of care is phenomenal and far surpassed what I even expected. It's really a blessing to be able to go, so I'm grateful for that.\nWhat you've been through so far is more than most will ever face. And then add MS, Lupus and other autoimmune issues to that?!?! That's more than any one person should have to bare. It has to be a testament to your strength and resiliency that you're here and posting your story. Thank you for sharing it.\nI look forward to chatting more with you in the future!",

But, we're only online friends. I agree with the suggestion to find an MS Support group.\nIf you have transportation, another suggestion is to seek out other opportunities in your community, such as volunteering at a humane society to pet cats (maybe there will be people there you can befriend), or other volunteer opportunities that don't require much physical effort. For example, our local schools participate in a program sponsored by Big Brothers and Big Sisters called \"Bigs in Schools\". Reaching out to others can sometimes help us as much as being reached out to by others.\nYou don't mention your age, but if you are over 55, many communities have senior centers with activities that you could consider.

    "Post" : "May, yes I live near Aiken.\nMy neuro now is in Aiken, but I saw a MS neuro in Augusta GA for a while, and while it was helpful when I started seeing her after a while I was not getting anything more from there than from here closer to home. I DO wish that I had seen the MS neuro earlier in my journey.\nWe spent a LOT of time last year in the Columbia medical system - My husband had a stroke in 2016 caused by an AVM, and the Neurosurgeon at Palmetto Health Richland was one of the few in the US that would attempt to remove it (location - it was very deep). He was left with some major disability and is still trying to come to terms with that.\nHe saw a neuro opthamologist there that I will definitely go to if/when I have another flare up of ON .\nBut the neuros that he saw there were NOT MS doctors (mostly neurosurgeons). I am certain that here are some good MS doctors there (I did look once and saw that there was even an MS clinic there). Drawbacks for me are the driving distance (and I-20 is ALWAYS having work done on it), Not being familiar with Columbia and the fact that after 22+ years with MS I have discovered that there really isn't much that can be done for it.\nI am on a DMD vacation now, and the only one that I will consider at this time is Ty, but my current neuro (and even the MS specialist that I saw) don't feel that \"such a heavy hitter is recommended\" for me. I am stable and have had no major flare ups - just slow progressions.\nBUT the thought of going to Columbia for Ty infusions really is not practical. My husband can't drive. He runs into trees on the riding lawn mower, so I know he couldn't drive there . While I realize that many people have their infusions and go from there to work I would not be willing to be so far from home for at least my first couple of infusions.\nI believe that there a some people on MSW that live upstate who go to Atlanta to see their doctors (IMO going from bad to worse). If I were younger (age and MS wise) I would most likely be looking for the doctor that would work miracles, but for me unless somebody finds the CURE I will be happy with my neuro. He is not a MS specialist but treats a lot of MSers, is experienced and he actually treats me as an entire person NOT an MS patient. He not only listens to my thoughts and concerns he takes the time to explain things to me, and works with other specialists that I have to ensure that not everything is blamed on MS.\nKinda funny - he was actually the neuro I wanted when I was first told that I had MS (before I knew that the were MS specialists) but he was not taking new patients at that time. So I wasted 15 years with a neuro that I didn't like and who didn't do near enough for me .\nGood to hear that you have found a doctor that you like. It's the pits when you have to see one that you feel doesn't have the time to be bothered with you.\nHow long have you been dx'ed? Are you on any DMD at this time?",

My best friend also had an AVM removed by a specialist at the same hospital and probably the same neurosurgeon! (2015 @ 50yrs old) She had the AVM all her life and no doctor would touch it! But, it finally ruptured and had emergency surgery and it saved her life. She has made close to a full recovery (miraculously). However, they also found a pseudo tumor that causes her some issues, but it is inoperable and all they can do it watch it and hope that it doesn't cause any serious problems.\nI'm sorry your husband was left with disabilities. My friend's recovery was definitely a miracle.\nI am 48 and was diagnosed in 2012. I have been on and off Copaxone since. No issues with the drug at all. Sometimes, I just like to take a break from it because I know that all DMD's lower your immune system. I have relapsing remitting and so far, I have no progression or legions. However, I was hospitalized Oct-Nov and in a medically induced coma for some of that time for an unexplained virus and my body was not responding to treatment. I made a full recovery, but the first week of Dec, when I was released, I fell and broke my pelvis in 2 places and fractured 2 vertebrae!\nI am fully recovered from the pelvic fractures and the vertebrae are almost healed but are causing disc problems and sciatica, so while I can walk and drive, I still have a lot of pain and numbness in my back that radiates down my right leg and both of my feet are numb and tingling. I am seeing my neurologist tomorrow to see if the numbness and tingling in my feet is my back problem or an MS issue. It's hard to tell! I'm going to get my annual brain MRI and I'm going to ask for a spinal MRI to make sure that I don't have lesions that are causes the problems in my feet. I hope and pray that I am still legion free!! And that this can all be chalked up to my back problems!\nI'm glad to hear that your MS is not causing you any major problems and I hope for that in the future too!\nDo you work? I was put on disability because I worked on Lake Murray and had a very physically demanding job. I had private long term disability insurance, but they required me to apply for SSDI and now I have that as well. So, I feel very, very fortunate all around concerning my situation.

    "Post" : "Hi May.\nOUCH on your fall! The ongoing problems with that must be the pits. Hope you feel much better soon . And I hope that your MRI shows no lesions .\nGlad to hear that your friend came thru an emergency AVM surgery without any disability. I agree that was a miracle! My husband now has worse \"MS\" symptoms than I do - cognitive problems, loss of balance and trouble finding and speaking words. He lost all right side vision, but a surprising problem is that after the surgery he can't read . This is an intelligent, college educated man who suddenly can't read a kindergarten book. I don't know if not being able to read or not being able to drive is the worse for him.\nYes I am retired on disability also. I worked at SRS. I worked w/o any major problems for 15 years after dx (with disclosure to any/everyone), but ended up with a supervisor that did not want anyone with MS on his crew . I started having fatigue and memory problems (MS related as a direct result of the stress that he had me under).\nThe site doctor called my supervisor and had him on speaker when I was there on a return to work visit, and the supervisor said point blank that since there were no jobs for me that it would be in my best interest to retire. Otherwise I would lose my job. I had too much time vested to loss it because of an ignorant power hungry you know what . This was in 2006.\nI had LTD on my job and they too required me to file for SSDI. As it turned out it was a blessing in disguise to NOT be working. Prior to the AVM my husband was insulin dependant diabetic and has had more low blood sugar episodes than I can count. I have had to go to his job to get him numerous times and have had to call the EMTs to revive him enough times that they recognize him around town, not even talking about all of the times I was able to get his sugar up by myself. There is NO WAY that I could have cared for him and worked too.\nON drove my MS dx, and I started on Avonex. I took it off and on for about 8 years before I just quit it. Since I have a true needle phobia that was not the best med for me but at the time all of the DMDs were injections. Yeah I did well on it, but the stress of the weekly injections was more than I cared to endure. When Gilenya was approved I started it, and took it faithfully for about 5 years. Then I developed too many severe side effects and simply stopped taking it. My neuro would prefer that I be on a DMD but I would prefer to have a QOL that doesn't involve side effects - especially when they make me feel so much worse than I do without the meds.\nI just realized that I have been retired for 12 years! It was rough at first not working, but then I got married and that has provided me with plenty of distractions . I also have an almost 7 yo granddaughter that made plans today to spend the night with me next week. I do volunteer work, work the media room at my church once a week and have a regular farm to tend to (fruit trees and veg plots, chickens, barn cats - just had a new kitten show up a week ago - and yard dogs - had a stray puppy show up 3 weeks ago that moved in and he is pure puppy) so I stay too busy now days to miss working.\nAs somebody else said \"It is a good life and I even get paid to do the things that I want to do\" (well, as much as I am able to). Considering that I am now 56 years old and that the first symptoms that were attributed to MS showed up 28 years ago I think that I am doing great! Of course it took until 1996 for a dx of MS .",

But I'm definitely tired of dealing with it. I just finished my dose of Lemtrada that my neurologist prescribed. So far so good now I'm just dealing with the post medication aftermath. Having to flush my system about a gallon of water a day so I don't have cytokine release syndrome. I started my Ms by being on avonex back in 09 for about 6 years, then tried tecfidera that did not work well at all as far as side effects. Next was plegridy which seem to do okay but I got tired of all the shots and being a pincushion. After that was Aubagio which I thought was going to be good but ended up not working at all for me which is why I had this last major flare-up which led to Lemtrada.\nHopefully this will be the last night I ever take and my body will go back to somewhat normal. The One symptom I'm still currently dealing with but I'm hoping we'll go away or correct itself is overactive bladder issues with frequency and urgency. I can't spend the rest of my life being 20 minutes away from the bathroom if I drink something while trying to live daily life. Anyways that's me in a nutshell.\nHi Josh Welcome!\nThanks for sharing your story with us.\nGood luck with your Lemtrada treatment! I have read some positive articles recently about Lemtrada and improvements.\nIt would be great if your overactive bladder issues get better. You never know!\nHope you find MSWorld to be interesting and helpful. Looking forward to more posts from you.\nTake Care",

Both of these might be available at your local health food store. Another option is to look for them at amazon.com .\nMy MS Specialist says that some patients like to use the med Oxybutynin for overactive bladder. You could ask your doc about that, but I've found the supplements to be more effective for me.",

    "Post" : "Hello Holly,\nYou are correct that an LP would be helpful for diagnosis.\nThe presence of OCB bands in cerebrospinal fluid is used in the diagnosis of MS. Please see... Research: oligoclonal bands in CIS increase your risk of conversion to MS http://multiple-sclerosis-research.b...m/search?q=CIS\nSince you quite possibly have CIS, I suggest you type CIS in the search box at that site to begin educating yourself.\nYou will find a wealth of valuable info at that site. Information you can use to improve your chances for good health.\nI'll quote some of only one article at that site since you asked specifically about insisting on having an LP... and you are absolutely correct insisting on an LP...\nResearchSpeak: converting from CIS to Multiple sclerosis\nDo you know if you have OCBs in your spinal fluid? #MSBlog #MSResearch #ResearchSpeak\nhttp://multiple-sclerosis-research.b...om-cis-to.html\n\"The Mouse Doctor wants me to highlight our international CIS study's findings. The results are important in that they confirm that the best predictor we have of having a second attack of MS is the presence of local synthesised oligoclonal IgG (immunoglobulin G) bands in the CNS (central nervous systems). This test is done on the spinal fluid and is one of the reasons why I prefer to make the diagnosis of MS with the help of spinal fluid analysis. Although you can make the diagnosis of MS without a lumbar puncture, and spinal fluid analysis, you are less likely to be misdiagnosed as having MS when you have a MS mimic with spinal fluid analysis...\n\"I am also in the camp that accepts that OCBs are an important part of the MS pathology and are driving MS disease progression. These OCBs are highly selected antibodies and there is a large body of evidence emerging to support the hypothesis that OCBs are pathogenic and responsible for driving many aspects of the MS pathology, in particular the gray matter lesions in the cortex. This is why in the future we may need to clear the CNS of OCBs if want to prevent the delayed non-relapsing secondary progressive phase of the disease.\"\n\"Does this have relevance for pwMS? Yes, if I had MS I would want to know if I had OCBs. The latter are part of the diagnostic criteria and provide prognostic information. You can never have enough information about your disease. I predict that we are about to enter a phase where we try different treatments to get rid of the OCBs, i.e. treatments to eliminate the plasma cells from the CNS of MSers. Watch this space!\"\nBest of luck to you, Holly. I am so sorry you needed to be here but I congratulate you because you have already begun educating yourself about your health concerns. If your knowledge does not extend beyond what your doctors tell you, your health will suffer immeasurably, IMHO. Life has taught me that lesson and confirmed it many times over. Knowledge is power. And, it is health, also. The site I recommended will increase your knowledge of issues you are facing.\nRolly",

Often, as we age with MS, our RRMS can progress to SPMS, and, instead of flares and new lesions, we are more likely to experience progression when additional damage in our existing lesions occurs.\nA neurologist can often help to manage flares with steroids (IV solumedrol). Have you talked with your neuro about your current flare? They can also treat symptoms (such as your spasticity). But, primary care physicians are also good at symptom management.\nI've read, recently, that CBD oil can help with spasticity. You can purchase that online, without a rx.

    "Post" : "Hi Sheerwill!\nThank you for sharing your experience with MS. When I was first diagnosed 5 years ago, it was the scariest time in my life. As I sat in the hospital (after being admitted from the ER because they didn't know what was going on with my double vision) at 3 am, I remember sobbing in the family room on the phone with my mom and she just gave me scripture after scripture and it was a balm to my soul. I know God heard my cries and continues to hear my prayers.\nWhen I was given the diagnosis a few months later and the dr told me to start researching which drug I wanted to go on, I was hesitant. All those side effects! It was daunting and scary. But I prayed about it and researched it and it was on these boards that someone told me something that, although I may not remember the exact wording, the message still resonates with me. They said that \"While you can go off the medication at any time you wish, you can never go back in time to start it earlier.\" That was, to me, my answer to prayer about whether or not I should go on a DMD.\nNow, 5 years later, I have been on Tecfidera since then. I just turned 40 years old. I still play volleyball on a competitive league. I can keep up with my husband and two girls (7 & 9). I have had no new relapses and no new lesions. I still work full-time and even started a side job doing photography.\nI don't know what my life would look like without the DMD. Maybe it would look the same. But I keep telling myself that I'm not taking the Tecfidera to feel good NOW. I'm taking the Tecfidera to feel good when I'm in my 50's, 60's, 70's and beyond. That I can still enjoy being active, that I can enjoy retirement with my husband, that my quality of life later will be what I hope it to be.\nI know that tomorrow is not a guarantee, but for me, I felt like this was something I could do to protect my future.\nNow, I want to be honest with you--the side effects of the drugs. Yes, I have thinner hair than I used to--but I look at my mom (and dad!) and wonder if that's the drugs or just genetics. I have the occasional flushing which I wonder if has caused or triggered what I think might be rosacea. I am battling cavities, but again, is it the medication or just the way my teeth are? As far as the brain disease and the scarier side effects--the drs are aware of them--which is why they test you for signs of them. And if your blood and/or urine tests start looking out of the ordinary, they watch you and test more often.\nI encourage you to continue to pray for wisdom in this decision. I also encourage you to look at the message boards regarding the different types of medications and side effects (just remember that there are thousands more people who are on the medication who DON'T have side effects). And if you see something that you would like better than what your dr is suggesting, then talk to your dr about it.\nUltimately, as you know, it's YOUR decision! I wish you all the best!",

    "Post" : "DMD?\nSheerwill,\nYou have me by 1 year. My MS kicked in about 31 years ago with left foot drop. I was very active, healthy, played lots of sports, and was a 5K runner. But unlike you, I did not ask for God’s help, was grateful for what abilities I still had and have today, and did take my doctor’s recommendations.\nTook DMDs for many years, on and off Avonex, Copaxon, Rebif, and hated them all. Also took several pills, Carbamazapine, Nuerontin, prednisone, and others and never liked taking pills even aspirin for a headache. Do not like shots or side effects although they usually diminish with time. Not a big vitamin/supplement person either, prefer to eat well to get required nutrients.\nI always read the fine print and details of any studies and was not impressed with any of the stats, the % improvement seemed marginal at best. I honestly don’t think that any of the DMDs helped, but they did reduce my quality of life. So, I quit taking any about 8 years ago and did not notice a change, just felt better.\nHowever, I did start taking Rituxan (predecessor of Ocrevus) just over 4 years ago and my progression has seemed to have slowed a bit. I never noticed any improvement while on a DMD. I believe that there are 2 treatments today that are the most effective, but you really need to do your own research and not just go with what the drug companies and all the bleeding hearts tell you. Note also that even in the scientific studies a lot of patients experience improvements due to the placebo effect.\n1. Rituxan/Ocrevus have some positive results as I just stated\n2. The recent study and post on using your own harvested blood stem cells to reboot your immune system. (but seems targeted toward younger population with RRMS, not for us older/progressives)\nMy suggestion is to talk to your doctor about Rituxan/Ocrevus if you haven’t already. The results of the studies are much better than any of the DMDs. But you probably won’t find any studies on Rituxan for MS because it’s not financially beneficial for the drug company to do one since they are pushing the more expensive Ocrevus.\nI will be 61 this year, still walk with/without a cane, have many common symptoms, weakness/muscle atrophy on my left side, pain, stiffness, tingling, numbness, heat sensitivity, intense itching at times (uncommon), and others. I have a technical/engineering background and taught middle school sciences for 12 years, which I am stating only to let you know that I do try to look at things critically and make informed decisions.\nBest of luck (and God’s will)\nScott",

    "Post" : "Sheerwill,\nMy experience has been so similar to yours that I felt I needed to respond! I had very minor and intermittent symptoms over the years, starting with double vision in my early 20's. My only other real symptoms were some hand and foot numbness and bladder issues. I wasn't diagnosed until 2013 when I was 49, and went on Aubagio at that time, since my neuro thought it would give me a better prognosis for the long term.\nSince my diagnosis I am much more aware of balance issues and instability walking than I was aware of prior. Even though I would love to wear cute shoes, I recognize that I'm much more stable in a lace up running shoe. I have sprained my ankle three times in a 6 month period, so I have just had to learn to slow myself down and really be careful where I walk.\nI haven't had too many side effects from the Aubagio at all. I have lost a lot of hair, but it's so fine and thin anyway, that I don't think it's that noticeable. I haven't noticed that it's caused any excess weight gain, I would attribute that to being able to move and exercise less. Unfortunately, long walks are much harder on me a lot of the time than they used to be.\nI have also taken a good supply of vitamins, including all of the ones you mentioned. I take a lot of Vitamin D, and my numbers whenever they're checked are all in the right range. If I were you, I would not hesitate to follow what your doctor suggests as far as using a DMD. Aubagio has been fine for me, where I was not a candidate for Gilenya, and couldn't tolerate Tecfidera.\nBest of luck to you!",

If there is someone in your family who is willing to do a lot of research and reading for you WITHOUT telling you what to do, this person could read George Jelinek´s website overcomingmultiplesclerosis and Terry Whals´book. The two of them have a lot of overlap, but do disagree on some things. This person could also be your researcher on the various meds out there esp. how effective they are vs. the safety and side effects they come with. You CAN do a lot with regards to lifestyle and at this point of digesting your diagnosis, learning calming breaths would do a lot for you. If you inhale through your nose and exhale through your nose with the exhale LONGER than the inhale, it puts your body into a relaxed state.\nI told people who were curious but who didn´t get it that MS is like the Northern Lights in terms of symptoms coming and going without warning. Unfortunately MS is not as beautiful and uplifting, but the person got the part about constant changes. You could also ask your family to read the spoon comparison of MS and how much energy someone has in a day.\nKeeping a journal would be really helpful especially in terms of getting a referral for PT or OT. You´d be amazed how much a PT can teach you to regain strength.\nFor now, allow yourself the time to digest this crappy news and learn self-calming techniques.\nCyberhugs.",

I then went on the most effective med Tysabri and have been on it for over 11 years. It made my lesions ( MRI ) smaller or gone, I still have no new or active lesions. My sx abated (some, my biggest, R leg drags it didn't help), progression halted and I have had a great QOL (quality of life) and still do\nI knew/know about the RARE side effect of pml . My neurologist watched/tested me. The American Academy of Neurologist did a trial and found that after being on Tysabri for 2 years those who were infused every 56 days, instead of 24 had no incidence of pml, not 1 case. I think it is still holding or my neuro would have told me. I think it's about 3 years I've been going 56 days.\nI believe in being positive and living life. I do not stick my head in the ground but, I do not give ms my power..I may have ms but, it does not have me.\nI am just sharing my story\nLinda",

I like hearing others stories to help me kinda of get an idea of what MS can be like and the steps I could or should/shouldn't be taking!\nI would love to know more about the meditation you were doing and precautions you were taking those years before you stopped! I feel like I want to be able to say that I don't respect nor allow MS to have me.\nI'll make sure to talk to my doctor about Tysabri. I was offer Extavia or Glatopa by my doctor, in which I chose Extavia since the injections are every other day rather than daily.\nI will strive to not allow MS to have me, and to be as positive as possible!\nThank you!!\nOh and to Temagami-\nThank you so much! I keep reminding myself it's not about how flexible I am, it's about connecting to my body and getting to know what works and what doesn't! I'm trying to find a nice yoga place close to me that offers those types of classes!!!\nThank you all so much!\n- Hanna",

Most of us have a certain amt of symptoms in common, but when you think of our complex brain workings and numerous neuro pathways, it a wonder that some of us share commonalities, yet many of us do not.\nIt's good to hear you are on Tsyabri soon after being diagnosed. I'm a firm believer that hitting it with \"bigger guns\" in the beginning will help in the long run. Me? I was not so lucky, but for others, I'm glad we have so many better choices now.\nIt's perfectly normal to have differing thoughts creep in about your future. We all share in that.

    "Post" : "Hi Jenn,\nYour MS diagnosis was so shocking for you, as it would be for anyone. I am so sorry. The lack of empathy your neuro demonstrated was shocking, too. Forgive him if he is too busy to be more human; time will change him.\nBut I give him lots of credit for starting you on Tysabri. IMO, that is precisely the right DMT for the sudden and dramatic symptoms you described. I'm sure other factors entered into the treatment choice, also. He may lack bedside manners but he doesn't seem to be lacking treatment skills.\nAlong with many others, I believe it is best to hit MS early and hard. Tysabri does that brilliantly. There are many testimonies to that effect right here at MS World.\nMathematically speaking, it is more probable that you will stabilize and recover function on Tysabri than most other DMTs. And, with a great deal fewer side effects than other DMTs, too. Many taking Tysabri experience few or no side effects. My wife was one of those. She was on Tysabri from 2002 until 2017, except for one year when it was not available. She transitioned to Ocrevus last year and continues doing very well.\nJenn, lots of MSers have taken Tysabri for many years with great success. As the MS symptoms you have been experiencing slow down you will begin recovery and you will begin feeling better. Your brain will begin figuring work-arounds of damaged areas (lesions) using something commonly termed \"neurological reserve\".\nThe beauty of Tysabri is that it is so effective in slowing or halting inflammation and new lesions that it gives your brain opportunity to recover and develop new pathways using neurological reserve.\nWarning... If the brain exhausts its neurological reserve, that is when someone with RRMS transitions from relapsing-remitting MS to secondary progressive MS. Please understand that point, won't you? Therefore, it is critically important to get on the most effective DMT as soon as possible; delaying the progression of MS as long as possible or, even halting progression.\nI believe you will recover far, far, more than what your present symptoms may suggest to you. Years ago for a brief period, I spoon fed my wife and helped her with every bodily function. Today, she leads Silver Sneakers and Yoga classes at the local YMCA. We believe she is able to do that because she was fortunate enough to get on a very effective DMT, Tysabri, during trials and stay on it for 15 years. She never got a new lesion on Tysabri and her brain obviously figured ways around the damaged areas.\nTysabri is the same choice you and your neuro made, so congratulations! I believe you will have the same results, too! Believe it, girl, you are going to get better...much, much, better and become the dynamite grandmother you will surely be!",

It took almost 2 years for me to be dx, so no meds at all then. Next, I started on Betaseron, which, for me, was not effective. However, my neuro didn't take me off and try something different. Then, after switching to an MS Specialist, she put me on Copaxone, which worked well for me for a lot of years. The newer meds weren't out at that time, but, it may have been a good idea to switch to the \"bigger guns\" after they were.\nBut, the past year or two or three, I've begun to notice a lot of decline in my mobility and stamina. I'm 55; have had MS for 16 years. Probably transitioning from RRMS to SPMS.\nI hope your current symptoms will go away. They often do. You're still in the early stages of RRMS.",

    "Post" : "No help from me, either ... sorry! I just wanted to say that I have had 4 (or so??) MRIs in the past and nothing has ever shown up as \"MS Specific\", although everything points to MS. The neurologist said sooner or later the spots will show up. I'm not sure I like that mindset, but it is what it is.\nOh yes, she also said she would have already diagnosed me with MS if it weren't for the McDonald Criteria. That was about 7 years ago (???), the first time I saw a neurologist.\nI have taken breaks from doctors over the years - this most recent break has been a few years I think. I get frustrated and figure what's the point anyway if I am not going to take their drugs? At least not yet. I'm ready now to go back and try again. We'll see!!! My symptoms have steadily been worse and worse, and I am nearly convinced it's PPMS. My GP has done 'fifty billion' tests, twice [with about 4 years in between the tests], and still has not found anything.\nIt's a bit humbling to go from super active, in shape, \"healthy\", etc, to needing a cane, needing a wheel chair at times, and all of the other things that go wrong with me. The cognitive side is the worse. I say, put me in a wheel chair for the rest of my life, but please leave my brain alone!\nI just take each day as it comes and am thankful for all of the love and support I have.

If you don't mind did you contact it before they did testing for the JCV antibodies and created risk assessment matrix?\nHow have you recovered? I am sure it has been a long road. You may want to post a thread titled PML in the general board and ask your questions. It may get more views there.\nCan understand your reason for stopping Copaxone. I think they are going to do some research on age and MS, at least I hope. Hoping the old theory that MS burns itself out is true so it will make the decision to stop a DMT easier.\nLook forward to more posts.",

To answer your questions, I knew that I was JCV positive before I acquired PML but my titer was low. I took a risk that I now regret. I was told my risk of PML on Tysabri was 1 in 10,000, but I now believe that it was much higher.\nI appear like a person who has had a major stroke with residual disability. I am unable to use my right arm and right leg and speaking is very difficult. I walk slowly with a cane. I have had two seizures where I ended up in the hospital and for which I probably will have to take Kepro for the rest of my life. My remaining symptoms are the usual MS symptoms (chronic fatigue, depression, blurry eyesight, numbness, tingling, incontinence, etc.), only slightly worse. Still, my neurologist considers me a PML success story!\nI saw him two days ago and we discussed medical marijuana. To my surprise, he encouraged me to see if it could help and I went home and registered with the state. I now have to go to a certifying physician who will certify that I have one of the seventeen serious medical conditions for which medical marijuana is approved. I then pay the state a fee and get my medical marijuana card. Then a trip to the nearest marijuana dispensary. I am anxious to see if it will help.",

Not sure if I will just extend out the dosing to 8 weeks or stop. Your story will give me a lot to think about.\nI am very sorry to hear that both you contracted PML and that you are left with disabling symptoms.

Maybe you have already done so to address the PTSD, but this is different. Having lesions on you frontal lobe can affect your personality greatly!\nThis article is abut traumatic brain injury, but explains that lesions in the frontal lobe can cause many symptoms.\n\"The frontal lobes are considered our emotional control center and home to our personality. There is no other part of the brain where lesions can cause such a wide variety of symptoms (Kolb & Wishaw, 1990). The frontal lobes are involved in motor function, problem solving, spontaneity, memory, language, initiation, judgement, impulse control, and social and sexual behavior. The frontal lobes are extremely vulnerable to injury due to their location at the front of the cranium, proximity to the sphenoid wing and their large size. MRI studies have shown that the frontal area is the most common region of injury following mild to moderate traumatic brain injury (Levin et al., 1987).\"\nhttps://www.neuroskills.com/brain-in...ntal-lobes.php\nThanks for reaching out to us and let us know if we can be of more help.

A Physical Therapist is a really good place to start for an evaluation and help in rebuilding your Core Body Strength. Many of the exercises can be done on your bed but it's important to make those exercises life long.\nIt is possible to see improvement through Physical Therapy although it takes time and commitment on your part.

However the last month of pain (and I can handle some) seems to be all consuming.\nI will look into core strenghthening excersises; I have been completely lax in being pro active on this.

I am learning to stop looking at everything I cannot do or get to, but to celebrate what I can do/have done.\nHave you tried meditation? There are guided meditation on itunes, etc. I use Spotify, and found some great ones. Also, regarding spasticity, I could not live without my magnesium tablets. I take 500 mg at bedtime. When very bad, I climb into the tub with a cup or so of Epsom Salt. I do not currently exercise but I am going to start SLOWLY with stretching.\nYour screen name says it all.

I Had them test my blood for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues and everything else. Recenlty there vs just did an MRI of my brain. I am awaited results.\nIf you don't mind my asking, how did you do on your clinical neurological exam (coordination and strength, nerve sensations, reflexes, etc.)?\nOriginally posted by Currycur View Post\nI guess I am wondering if this is what it feels like? I also notice that maybe it fluctuates with my hormones? And the attacks are happening monthly now and more frequent. So right as my period comes they die down and are okay for a while, until the first of the month.\nMS symptoms vary from person to person. My initial symptoms involved gait disturbances, bladder issues, limb weakness, heat sensitivity, and muscle fatigue. I had no pain whatsoever.\nSo as you can see, clinical symptoms alone are not enough to discern MS from other conditions.\nGood luck - let us know what you find out, and what your neuro says about your MRI results.\nIf your diagnosis is MS, this is a good community of people with MS who can help you with support, shared experiences, and information.

Having one anomaly (lesion) show up on a brain MRI doesn't necessarily indicate MS.\nMultiple Sclerosis = Multiple = many -- Sclerosis = scaring. At this time you have one(1) lesion which does not equate to Multiple (Sclerosis). Not all lesions on MRI means Multiple Sclerosis. There are many different reasons a person could have a lesion show up on MRI.\npeople with primary progressive ms have very few if any MS lesions on their brain.\nI have had MS diagnosed for almost 30 years with symptoms that go back to childhood. This disease has pretty much left my brain alone. The damage this disease has done is on the spinal cord.\nI was diagnosed as Relapsing/Remitting NOT Primary Progressive.\nThis is not a somatoform disorder, there is no way that I made up the sensation of pins and needles in my mind when I walk outside into the cold.\nIf you have been diagnosed with a Somatoform Disorder your symptoms are very real, it just wouldn't be due to MS.\nThose are the nerves reconnecting.\nNo, Phoenix1991.\nThose of us with MS can be heat intolerant, cold intolerant or both. This process does not mean our nerves reconnect, although that would be nice.\nThere is no treatment for PPMS. Your axons die, then you die. It's a neurodegenerative disease, much like Alzheimer's.*\nMultiple Sclerosis is nothing like Alzheimer's.\nThe diagnostic criteria for Primary Progressive MS:\nhttp://www.nationalmssociety.org/Wha...Progressive-MS\nThe urinary tract is the specialty of a Urologist. If you have not been to a Urologist about your urinary problems please do so.\nI would like to stress the importance of seeking the help and guidance of the Mental Health Professional. This would be beneficial in helping you cope with what ever diagnosis you may receive. This is also for your own safety and welfare.\nTake care and Merry Christmas",

I also believe that most of us here, on these boards, understand exactly what you are going through. We know the pain. We know the frustration of trying to explain ourselves in words that others understand, but even then the others (family, friends, doctors, etc.) just don't \"get it\" and we suffer because of that. We know the exasperation of trying and trying and trying to no avail, then just throwing our hands up into the air giving up knowing that no matter what we say or do, \"they\" just will never understand.\nSo, please, tell me about your leg and how it gets numb in the heat. Does it hurt in the kind of way where it's burning? Just tingling, pin pricking? Is it hurting in your foot? Ankle? Up the calf to your knee? Does it hurt in your thigh? Just one side? How hot does it have to get to trigger this numbness?\nI'd like to know. So, please tell me so that I can compare your pain to that which I'm feeling in my leg.

    "Post" : "Hi Phoenix,\nI'm so sorry you are feeling so down, and are feeling even more discouraged since you saw the MS Specialist. I can't say whether you have MS or not, or even what type you may have. Only a neurologist would be qualified to determine that.\nWhat we all can do is offer you our support, understanding, and knowledge. We can also help walk you through the diagnostic process, and point you in the direction of symptomatic management (you don't even need a MS dx). I only hope you'll give us all a chance. There are so many members here who would be more than willing to do that! (And just so you know, there are even different spectrums of PPMS, ranging from mild to severe.)\nI know you don't believe this right now. But, you are also early enough in this game if it is indeed MS. Early enough to benefit from current treatment or new ones still in the pipeline.\nI know you are scared. It's entirely understandable! All of us have been there. Or are there right now. And many of us have been in the same dark place you find yourself now. (I have been one of them and managed to get the right help just in time.) But, there is still hope on the other side. Please don't give up.\nThere are advances happening all the time with MS research. One of the most exciting going on right now is remylinating the nerves. Not all that long ago it wasn't even considered a possibility. Now it is and several different compounds are in clinical trials right now. The one in stage 2 clinical trials is called Anti-lingo. Once they can do that, it will stop MS in it's tracks and halt any further destruction/ progression. Whatever damage that may have already been done will also improve, because nerve signals will once again be able to travel again down those nerve pathways.\nThe other is stem cell research. The ones showing exciting promise right now for MS are mesenchymal and neural stem cells. (In fact, both were just used back to back on a legendary hockey player, Gordie Howe, who had suffered a major stroke with miraculous results! I can't imagine the possible implications this may have for repairing neurons and restoring function in MS as well.)\nThey are also getting closer to figuring out how to test potential MS therapies in a petri dish. They'd basically clone human MS cells and use them to determine whether a therapy was effective or not in MS. That would be huge. No more waiting until potential therapies went through years of clinical trials. They are also looking at ways to repair any damage that has already occurred. Great news to the ears of anyone with progressive MS.\nPlease do whatever you need to so you can climb out of the despair you are in right now. Call the number Seasha and Mamabug provided for starters. Then, seek out some professional help and don't give up trying to find out what is wrong until you have answers! Only then can you can receive proper treatment, to hopefully turn things around. It would be even more devastating to your loved ones if you took your own life and then, after an autopsy (required for any suspicious death), whatever is going on turned out to be no where near as bad as you had thought it was.\nAnd as you've been reading this, you might be thinking I don't have progressive MS. I do. Or it can't be that bad or that I have a lot of understanding and support from people surrounding me. Neither is true. No one gets it, not even the doctors. Just tonight someone close to me (who should've known better) said something stupid and very hurtful. But I still wake up and fight this every day. I'm no one special and never thought I could handle this, either. But, I've found I can. You can, too!\nPlease hang in there. God's not ready for you yet! Please keep coming back and asking questions or just sharing your fears or concerns. We are all here for you and care.",

    "Post" : "I don´t have experience with ON so I leave that to others to help you out. I do go to an opthamologist who does an OCT scan that checks the myelin on the optic nerve. The machinery takes a photo and then you have a baseline for going forward. I would check out George Jelinek´s website and the beauty of it is that he has done so much of the research that you can find most of what you are looking for there and now he has an OMS cookbook. If you have not explored meditation, I highly recommend it- meditation turns off inflammatory genes and turns on genes that promote healing. The anxiety of the diagnosis is reason alone to meditate. Breath work will help immensely- google the relaxation response (credited to Herbert Benson, but taken from eastern cultures) and you can learn it in about 2 minutes. I too am a googler and scared myself silly initially. For me, knowing the worst case scenario was part of the process of accepting the diagnosis. It is a process and you will start to google research that is encouraging instead of horror stories. Check out the blog at Barts in London- great research blog with interesting comments.",

I still look and feel quite healthy, but had a new lesion on recent MRI, despite being on Copaxone. Very few people who know me know I have MS. But this new lesion has motivated me to clean up my diet, just in case that will make a difference. I’m doing Wahls for now, but I’m spending many hours every week consuming research about different diets and on lipid metabolism as it relates to MS. I digress. Eating the way I do now is inconvenient and difficult to explain to people. I have told a few more people about my MS, a few close friends. I still don’t want the world to know. I don’t want my employer to know, even though it wouldn’t be a problem. Are any of you currently (or previously) struggling with the conundrum of who to tell and when? By the way, thanks for being part of this community. I need this.\nHi eventhis\nGood for you, researching diets, and trying to find one that works to help you feel and function at your best.\nI experimented over the years, and found that for me, a Mediterranean type diet seems to keep me feeling and functioning at my best. Of course we are all different, so what works for one doesn't necessarily work for everyone.\nRegarding the disclosure of having MS, that wasn't an issue for me.\nMy initial symptoms were motor (gait disturbances, limping, hand dexterity, etc) and they were visible and couldn't be hidden.\nIn any case, good luck to you - glad you have joined MSW!\nTake Care",

I could imagine right now you are feeling pretty uncertain about your life with MS.\nThe ride over really threw me off bad, my balance got off then nauseated and shaking but I was able to recover and finish the day. But yesterday I couldn't recover and I'm still feeling \"throwed off\" is what I call it lol.\nI'm worried about work\nDo I call the Dr and tell her I'm unable to work once I get there or just see if it's gonna get better\nI am wondering if fear and uncertainly is creating anxiety for you. Anxiety can cause what you are experiencing. Anxiety can be treated. A Psychiatrist would be best for prescribing anxiety medication but your Primary Dr. or Neurologist can also prescribe medication. A Psychotherapist would also be a good idea as a way to work through your concerns, fears, etc. about this recent diagnosis.\nMS and the uncertainty can cause a whole host of roller coaster emotions.\nTake care",

I hope you feel welcomed here and we can be of help to you, especially just being diagnosed.\nIf you find that going back to work continually exhausts you and brings on acute symptoms, you might want to check with your work about applying for short term disability. Your Dr. can help you with that. Or, you might just be able to \"wing it\" until you feel stronger? Get lots of rest and eat well.\nAre you on a DMT right now?\nI wish you better days ahead and take care of yourself!",

Fatigue and heat can bring on pseudo-symptoms that abate wants you rest or cool off. For me, both create that feeling off balance and mentally off.\nHave you started any new medications, either symptom management or a disease modifying treatment? Can side effects be playing a role?\nDo you eat breakfast? General health and nutrition can also play roles.\nI know you don't want to worry your adult children, but do you have anyone you can talk too? Social support can be crucial in helping adjust to a diagnosis, as well as dealing with ups and downs. This board is great, but it helps to have home support too. I used a therapist to get my fears out in a safe place, without worrying family in the early days.",

I haven't worked In almost 3 months but I am close to getting cleared to drive again.\ni usually just feed off the small gains I'm making and feel better a bit out myself, I always hiked and rode bike, jog, gym, weightlift, played sports and a lot of hockey and now my goal is to start jogging lightly again. It's a bit of an adjustment and I'm still in processsing the impact it has on me. I try and focus on the positives like my medication tecfidera has 0 side effects for me and hopefully this drug works for me otherwise it's onto tysabri for me.\nlife is changed it's just how you adjust, there's still lots you can do I improve your life and still do a lot. It's hard to control your anxiety I find but there's lots of research going on and the medication nowadays is far and beyond of what it was in the past, I believe that stem cell research will have a breakthrough in 10-15 years for a cure.

My neuro wanted me to move to a walker but my pride wouldn't allow it. I quit going in public if at all possible as even with a cane I walked like a drunk, still had falls and was terribly self conscious. My walking became more unstable & after a 4 fall week I realized I had to do something else. I opted for a mobility service dog instead of a walker. I'm quite tall so needed a big dog-a Great Dane fit the bill.\nI've had my wonderful service dog for three months now and haven't had a fall since. When I begin losing my balance he steps in front of my leg and braces me. I stumbled and started to fall down some stairs last month and he incredibly saved me from falling. My gait is improved with him to hold onto, I'm not so self conscious because people look at him not me when we're out, I go out every day to keep him (and me) exercised and practiced and he provides incredible companionship.\nIf your husband is a dog lover it may be an option he would consider. Assistance Dogs International is an excellent resource and if your husband happens to be a Veteran, the VA covers the cost and vet expenses for service dogs. Hope this is helpful.",

From the bible: \"Pride goeth before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall.\"\nHow I never broke bones, teeth, or suffered a concussion, I'll never understand. I resisted every assistive device until even I admitted I endangered the quality of my life.\nI finally concluded that my pride was unfair to the people who love me: my grandchildren, my children, my friends and my wife. Forcing them to continually grab my arm as I nearly fell when I staggered around finally made me see the light. I was being selfish.\nMy loving wife repeatedly explains to me that the devices I use to safely move around both inside and outside the house are not hateful reminders of my disabilities; but, rather, enablers that allow me to enjoy hundreds of things I might otherwise be unable to enjoy.\nI wish I had some magic spell that could prevent all the MSers from refusing help as they stagger and risk falls, pridefully trying to prove to the world that they aren't disabled.\nI have seen what a broken hip, broken arm or a concussion can do to a healthy person in their sixties. Believe me, their quality of life goes down very, very quickly. An injury is much, much worse than the embarrassment of using an assistive device.\nI pray your husband can somehow come to see that safety is important to his quality of life not only for his sake but for the sake of all those people who care about him and his welfare.",

    "Post" : "Hello from Ciincinnati- found less than &quot;stellar&quot; care\nHi All:\nI've been less than \"impressed\" with the treatment I've received from the Waddell Center at U.C. unfortunately and last week returned to the Cleveland Clinic for treatment at the Mellen Center. I was seen at Mellen after I shortly arrived in Cleveland (had a flare-was getting the house ready for sale in August). Yes, it's a bit of a drive,(and pricey - I spent 3 days in hotel and had to rent a car), received IV Solumedrol for 3 days and also saw a doctor who specializes in spasticity. For me it was well worth it. I lived in Cleveland from 2007 until 2012, my dad (who lived in Cincy) became seriously ill and I returned here to care for him.\nI recently had a flare again (I was diagnosed in 1995; and used to see both Dr. Melanson and Dr. Pirko, who I agree were both were great docs.\nI was hospitalized at U.C. in 2015 for another MS flare (3 days of IV steroids) and then a month at HealthSouth/Drake for rehab; I lost the ability to ambulate. They did a fantastic job; however the MS doctor (Dr. Zabetti) never came to see me while I was an inpatient; and despite my dx, PT did not visit me until the last day of my hospitalization. They apparently didn't get an \"order\". When I went for a follow-up office visit with Dr. Zabetti, he offered me Techfidera (which my insurance didn't cover) and when I told him I couldn't afford this, he said then there was \"nothing\" else he could offer. Very frustrating - he spent about five minutes with me, despite being a \"new patient\" for him.\nI've had another flare (in August) lots of spasticity in my arms and legs. I ended stopping into a into a \"My Clinic\" which is an outpatient/semi-urgent care facility that was located in a Kroger's. I stopped in to ask a question or two. I stopped in there after my PCP (who told me he does \"deal with MS\" and gave me a 10 day course of oral steroids that essentially did nothing for me!) The My Clinic nurse was fabulous, even though they're not set up to see someone with MS; she went above and beyond in taking care of me (spending an hour!) and \"tried\" her best to get me in \"urgently\" at Waddell - the best she could do was get me an appt. in mid-September. (They told me that all of their doctors were \"busy\" and/or were on vacation/attending conferences). I did get an appointment with Dr. Michelle Bowman - who is in West Chester. I live in Williamsburg, so it will be a bit of a haul, but I will give her a chance, I have a friend/who knows someone who sees her and likes her.\nI have fingers crossed/will see.......",

Everything was going great until recently when I experienced a strange episode that left me questioning the true state of my health. I'm looking to see if anyone else has had a similar experience.\nSo, here it goes... I felt completely fine all day and had two beers after dinner. While going to the bathroom I became extremely nauseas, lightheaded and dizzy. I stumbled out of the bathroom and almost fell over. I felt weak, extremely hot and sweaty. My gf was immediately concerned by the way I looked. She said I was extremely pale. She felt my forehead and said that my skin was freezing and clammy (the opposite of how I felt inside). I sat down with my heart racing and shallow breathing. My hands became extremely tingly. I took my temperature which read 94.4. Now the skin on my hands felt as though it was vibrating.\nI was ready to go to the ER after about ten mins of these strange symptoms but then it started to subside. My temp gradually rose back to normal. After doing some research online I can only assume that it was a case of autonomic dysreflexia. My neuro agreed that this could be the cause due to where my lesion was on my spine after my first attack. I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced this and if so perhaps you can shed some light on this condition and how frequent/infrequently it occurs.\nHi AntRM - welcome to MS World!\nI am not very familiar with autonomic dysreflexia (although I did look it up after reading your post).\nThe symptoms sound kind of scary. From what I have read, it seems that there are preventative measures that can be taken, and conditions to be aware of such as bladder infections or bowel obstructions, pressure sores, hemorrhoids, etc - anything that might cause pain or discomfort below the level of the spinal lesion.\nIn any case, hopefully for you this doesn't occur anymore.\nMaybe other members have experienced this also, and will respond.\nTake Care",

Some people have no problem drinking alcohol when having MS and some do. When I was diagnosed with MS this was one of the many things my Neurologist discussed with me.\nMuch of what you experienced is what happens to me (to a lesser degree) if I drink, sometimes as little as a few sips to half a drink. For this reason I rarely drink alcohol.\nSomething to consider: Many medications cannot and should not be combined with alcohol. Drinking alcohol with some medications can have serious side effects.",

Those two years included:\nthe loss of a job\nmonths of physical therapy and occupational therapy to deal with the stroke-like symptoms and the dizziness\nloss of income\nmany, many (did I say many?) tests including 6 more MRI's, a lumbar puncture\nruling out multiple other illnesses\na two-week trip to Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN and another \"probable\", but incorrect diagnosis\nseveral more additional MS flares\netc.\nNot everyone has such a long and difficult journey to diagnosis, but I wanted to share my story, as your journey also appears to have already been long.\nAnd, the next 15 years is another story. But, God is good. I have found blessings interspersed along with the losses.\nI pray for patience for you and your family, the best health that the upcoming months can offer, and a diagnosis that comes soon. Best wishes to you.",

    "Post" : "Hi and welcome,\nI agree try not to get too jazzed up until the MRI comes back. My guess is the doctor also ordered blood work to rule out mimics and his neuro exam would have likely included additional rule outs also so again just guessing but he probably didn't just go right to MS.\nI hope you don't have MS but if you do it isn't all that hard to diagnose in most cases. There are definitely some that take time for a diagnosis but many of us were diagnosed within a couple of weeks of symptoms presenting.\nPlease keep us posted.\nJules",

Just the MRI for now, I guess? I'm very confused. The worst of it for me is my gait (I waddle now and my right foot turns inward) back pain and brain fog/fatigue. My fingers and toes always hurt as well as my legs. I've been diagnosed with insomnia, depression and anxiety which I am current on meds for and have been for,years. I guess I always looked at these things as separate issues rather than one big issue? Do these things sound like MS to you?",
